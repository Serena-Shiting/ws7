Jeane J  Kirkpatrick  former Ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan  is the author of one of the three most famous essays in the history of American foreign policy    "Dictatorships and Double Standards   " Commentary (November 1979)--the other two being George F  Kennan's call for   "containment  " of the Soviet Union and The End of History by Francis Fukuyama   In it she argued that it was incumbent on the United States to differentiate between authoritarian regimes and totalitarian regimes   Authoritarian regimes she argued  like Iran and Nicaragua  though they obviously did not meet our preferred standards of democratization  were fundamentally just harsh  but traditional  governments of countries which had known no other type of government and were perhaps not yet ready for democracy      "Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth  power  status  and other  resources  which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty   But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos   They do not disturb the habitual  rhythms of work and leisure  habitual places of residence  habitual patterns of family and personal  relations   "Essentially  the autocracies protect their own power and wealth  but leave most other aspects of life relatively untouched   As the name implies  they are more concerned with who in society will wield authority  i e  themselves  than with imposing any particular ideology   Because this is the case  they in fact preserve many of the institutions upon which democracy can later be built  whether the Church or corporations or other civic organizations Totalitarian regimes  on the other hand  as the name implies  seek to totally reinvent and control every aspect of society   This requires them to so violate the existing institutions as to render the society nearly incapable of evolving into a democracy These fundamental differences between the two types of regimes suggest important reasons that we should be more rigorous in our approach to the one than the other   Because authoritarian regimes are less oppressive of their citizens and are more amenable to democracy they are more susceptible to pressure from without  but at the same time  particularly when Kirkpatrick was writing  at the very nadir of the Cold War  it was especially dangerous to destabilize these generally friendly regimes  particularly in light of the fact that they could be expected  over a period of years  to gradually transform themselves into more democratic societies Meanwhile  authoritarian regimes  like Cuba and Vietnam  though they tend to cast their ideology in the language of progressive democracy  which makes them seem somehow more akin to the U S   in reality are much more oppressive of their people and  because they destroy traditional institutions  tend to create such devastation that it is extremely difficult for external pressure to aid the rise of democracy   They are both worse for their people in the short run and more likely to endure in the long run This leaves America in a difficult position   Neither type of government vindicates our ideals of liberal democracy   We would of course like to see both become more democratic   But the regimes we can most easily change are the less offensive ones  and ones that are likely to be our de facto allies   Those regimes which truly brutalize their populations  and which at that time were generally allied with our enemy  the Soviet Union  tend not to be easily pressured Further complicating matters is the fact that in countries with authoritarian regimes  there tend to be reasonably well-organized and very well supplied guerrilla movements   This was particularly true when the Soviet Union and the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations existed and stood ready to support them   Totalitarian nations  with their much more restrictive internal controls  and with the U S  showing no interest in supplying indigenous rebellions  tended to be relatively free of organized civil unrest All of these factors combined in the late 1970's to bring about the bizarre and tragic situation whereby the government of Jimmy Carter basically helped to topple the Somoza government in Nicaragua and the Shah in Iran   In effect  this eliminated two friendly governments in important strategic locations  governments which while by no means ideal were hardly the two worst human rights offenders even in their own regions   In the ultimate perversity  it seemed that they were actually targeted by the Carter Administration precisely because they were so closely associated with the United States   Allies were destroyed  an action made possible because they were not as repressive as other regimes  and replaced by radical totalitarian regimes allied with the Soviet Union  with whom we were at war Looked at in the abstract like this  the Carter policy seems nearly suicidal   But Jeane Kirkpatrick traced it to a dangerous faith in Rationalism  as opposed to reliance on Realism  as the basis of foreign policy   The important thing to note here is that the critique of Rationalism that she offers is very similar to the general conservative critique of modern day liberalism   The Left has an almost alchemical notion of mankind  believing that any transmutation that they can arrive at rationally can be then be engineered socially   Able to imagine a utopian world in which Marxist guerilla leaders turn a illiterate  Third World  agrarian  nation into a liberal  egalitarian democracy (moreover  one that would be unfettered by such hoary institutions as the Church  the aristocracy  the military  etc )  they assume such an apotheosis to be imminent What Kirkpatrick was calling for was a foreign policy grounded in Realism   Hard experience has demonstrated time and again that revolutionaries who set out to completely transform a society end up imposing an even greater tyranny than the one they replace   Even more troublesome  they practically never fade away or evolve into democracies (at least they hadn't to that point--the collapse of Eastern European Communism offers a difficult counter argument)  they are likely to endure until they in turn are overthrown by conquest from without or violent counterrevolution from within   For these reasons  we are frequently  if not always  better off opting for the devil we know  the kind of traditional autocratic regimes which  though not democratic  at least offer stability and domestic order  tend to be fairly trustworthy allies  and frequently evolve into democracies   Kirkpatrick's theory was ultimately vindicated at least in this regard as this was basically the process which occurred in places like Spain  the Philippines  South Africa  Chile  and so on In fact  the current case of Russia provides a really difficult test of some the implications of theory   The complete failure of capitalism and democratic institutions to establish themselves in post-Soviet Russia begs the question of whether a brief period of fascist rule there might not have a salutary effect   First  it would allow central authorities to reestablish the rule of law  both by curbing crime and corruption and by restoring the notion of property rights   This sort of functioning legal system it now seems fair to say  is an absolutely imperative precursor of capitalism and democracy   Second  it would provide a period of relative physical security and cultural freedom during which civic institutions could be revitalized--the Church  political parties  corporations  the military  law enforcement  the judiciary  etc   Difficult as the prospect may be for us to accept  it may well be the case that a healthy Russian democracy will only flower in the wake of a period of authoritarian rule   This is notto suggest that we should aid Vladimir Putin in oppressing his own people or even that we should turn a blind eye  it is merely to suggest that it might be in our own best interests and ultimately those of the Russian people to allow him some latitude to restore order to that badly disordered nation  even if in so doing he sometimes offends our delicate democratic sensibilities Other essays in this collection range over a surprisingly wide field  including some perceptive observations on American domestic politics   The span of years and topics covered means that they don't necessarily fit together into a unified whole  but the dichotomy between reason and realism recurs often enough that they do present a coherent argument in the end   Thus  in an essay on the failure of the efforts to reform the political parties  she's essentially arguing that the reformers bought into an illusion that they could make the parties adhere to abstract principles  simply because they could imagine this happening Similarly  in discussing the failure of the New Right to capture either the presidency or the Republican Party nomination in 1976  as theorists like Kevin Phillips  Pat Buchanan  William Rusher  and others expected they would  she points out that their theories were based on a faith that would have required a genuine transformation in the American electorate   This faith  as the only incremental successes of even Ronald Reagan and the Republican Congress of '94 have demonstrated  was rather misguided   It may be true--I hope to God it is--that people are reasonably conservative at their core  but it is surely no coincidence that for the past seventy years they have consistently elected candidates who have promised them ever greater government benefits   While reason can build a case for why that should  even why it must  change  realism requires one to note the stubborn fact

If only a picture were actually worth a thousand words  you'd be able to look at the exquisite cover above and run right out and buy this beautiful book  rather than working your way through the thickets of verbiage that follow  At any rate  the author  S  Peter Lewis  and several  if not all  of the folks who helped him build his remarkable treehouse are outdoorsmen and fishermen  such that a book about a building project not infrequently references John Gierach and Nick Lyons  This is fitting because  besides being a bucolic sort of tale anyway  the book resembles nothing so much as a high quality fishing book  complete with watercolors  The attention to detail and design  the way the illustrations and photographs mesh with the text and the entire layout are reminiscent of the work of the great illustrator Barry Moser or of the young angling artist  James Prosek  whose art I like much better than his stories  but who manages to integrate them well  If you look back up at the picture above  you'll see most everything that makes this book so wonderful  First  there's the romance of the task itself  building a two story office around a tree--a feat they accomplished without driving metal into the trunk  Second  there's the characteristically whimsical touch of wrapping a stairwell around another nearby tree  Just as characteristic  as you study the structure and the entryway you'll start saying to yourself    "How'd they do that?  " in the book the question becomes    "Okay  we had the bright idea  now how do we do it?  " Too  you see the roots plunging deep into the soil and the branches reaching skyward  This is a story that's very much anchored in a very special place  Northern New England -- Maine in this case -- where you just aren't terribly surprised to hear a neighbor has embarked on such a foolhardy effort and sort of hope he needs help so you can satisfy your curiosity about how he's doing as well as have a hand in completing the thing  Last  there's the quality of the art work itself  both detailed enough to draw you into the process and lovely enough to awe you  Yes  I suspect you can figure out whether you'll like this book or not just by how you react to that picture  And  if you've a soul  I'm not sure how you can help but react quite favorably Though we're way behind on reviews I couldn't help reading the book as soon as I opened it  The art  mostly by T B R  Walsh  draws you in so much you feel like you're part of the project  The story  as told by Mr  Lewis  is as much about family and friends and neighbors working together and having joyous adventures and misadventures as it is about the nuts and bolts -- actually  mortise and tenons -- of the construction work  The treehouse was very much a collaborative effort and the book is so accessible that the reader becomes almost a collaborator  It's the nature of our winters up here and of the type of building they were doing that most of the work took place in the good weather months  and Mr  Lewis would find himself in the colder times leafing through his notebooks and examining plans daydreaming about the treehouse  I can hardly wait to pick the book up again on some frigid February day and enjoy the whole experience over again  Obviously we recommend this one most heartily  but in particular it seems like it would be a perfect gift book  especially for someone who likes tinkering around their house or anyone who appreciates beautiful books the art work itself  both detailed enough to draw you into the process and lovely enough to awe you  Yes  I suspect you can figure out whether you'll like this book or not just by how you react to that picture  And  if you've a soul  I'm not sure how you can help but react quite favorably   Though we're way behind on reviews I couldn't help reading the book as soon as I opened it  The art  mostly by T B R  Walsh  draws you in so much you feel like you're part of the project  The story  as told by Mr  Lewis  is as much about family and friends and neighbors working together and having joyous adventures and misadventures as it is about the nuts and bolts -- actually  mortise and tenons -- of the construction work  The treehouse was very much a collaborative effort and the book is so accessible that the reader becomes almost a collaborator  It's the nature of our winters up here and of the type of building they were doing that most of the work took place in the good weather months  and Mr  Lewis would find himself in the colder times leafing through his notebooks and examining plans daydreaming about the treehouse  I can hardly wait to pick the book up again on some frigid February day and enjoy the whole experience over again  Obviously we recommend this one most heartily  but in particular it seems like it would be a perfect gift book  especially for someone who likes tinkering around their house or anyone who appreciates beautiful books 
This first mystery in the Inspector Salvo Montalbano series introduces us to the sardonic but determined policeman  the imaginary Sicilian seacoast town of Vig&aacute;ta  and a cast of colorful characters  Mr  Camilleri's Sicily is just as thoroughly corrupt as you'd expect it to be and no one much seems to mind  other than Montalbano  who isn't about to let everyone else's eagerness to look away stop him from solving the murder of a respected local politician  The opportunity to let it slide by is ample  as it's not even apparent at first that a crime was committed  but the fact that the body was found in a trash yard that's a notorious pick-up spot for whores is sufficiently out of the victim's public character that the Inspector starts digging The particular strengths of the book are the setting that Camilleri brings to life -- not least by taunting us with the vittles Montalbano enjoys -- and the witty character of the Inspector  as well as his becoming determination to see justice done  even if he has to bend the rules himself on occasion 
Hunter S  Thompson's 1966 book Hell's Angels is a rather tedious ode to the repellent bikers and their supposed ethos that is redeemed only at the very end when they beat the stuffing out of the author and make an obvious hash of everything he's written up to that point  Chris Verrill is an altogether different man than Mr  Thompson was--it seems fair to say he's even one of the good men contemplated by his title--and this is an altogether different book than Thompson's  It details the world trip Mr  Verrill took in the wake of 9-11  seeking to start up an educational project in Afghanistan on behalf of the Pacifica Rotary Club  But the Mr  Verrill who sets out on this journey does have something of the innocence and naivety of a Candide and by journey's end has had a hefty dose of reality beaten into him  Good men may be required to do something to combat evil in the world  but that doesn't mean that the world will accommodate them by getting rid of red tape  bureaucracy  and other forms of foolishness One of the chief attractions of the book is the pleasant demeanor and sunny outlook on life that Mr  Verrill brings to his quest  Though not blind to America's faults he is confident that we mean well even in the more controversial aspects of the War on Terror  He's not a George Bush supporter  but is also unwilling to disavow him and the Administration's attempts to liberalize the Middle East  He'd prefer that we'd had the U N  imprimatur for the Iraq war  but no doubt that it's worth deposing Saddam  The many misunderstandings of America by the people he meets genuinely pain him  just as their own cultures fascinate him  He seems certain that if only we could all get together and know each other better we'd all get along The first half of the book is somewhat overlong  as we spend too much time preparing for the trip  traveling across America and then in Africa  the Mediterranean and even Central Europe  However  once Mr  Verrill gets to India and begins traveling to Pakistan and working on the project in earnest the book becomes more focused  It's here too that the author gets a dismaying education in just how difficult folks can make it to do even a good deed  The best portions of the book actually come at Mr  Verrill's own expense as his can-do attitude bumps up against bureaucrats and regulations that say no-you-can't or  at least  not-so-fast  The book ends up being a tragicomic variation on The Quiet American and an enjoyable read even if not quite the one the author hoped to give us India and begins traveling to Pakistan and working on the project in earnest the book becomes more focused  It's here too that the author gets a dismaying education in just how difficult folks can make it to do even a good deed  The best portions of the book actually come at Mr  Verrill's own expense as his can-do attitude bumps up against bureaucrats and regulations that say no-you-can't or  at least  not-so-fast  The book ends up being a tragicomic variation on The Quiet American and an enjoyable read even if not quite the one the author hoped to give us 
Because baseball is truly and uniquely the American pastime  you could quite possibly get a book's worth of material out of its history in all 50 states--and more than a few territories  Even Alaska used to host a Summer League  where they could play in sunlight most of the night  But Kevin Nelson mines the especially rich past of baseball in California from its earliest days as a state--in the 1850s--until its five professional franchises were all in place in 1969  Along the way he dips into the game's forays into radio  tv  and film; the last days of Ty Cobb; Jackie Robinson's emergence at UCLA; and on and on  Mr  Nelson's style is very conversational and he wends from topic to topic  If you're looking for someone to dot every   "i  " and cross every   "t  " or to give a rigid day-by-day history  he's not your man  But if you think you'd enjoy listening to a tale spinner meander around the Golden State and tell the stories that catch his fancy--accompanied by a remarkable collection of photos--this is a book you'll enjoy immensely 
As is the mysterious way of such things  I happened to have stumbled upon the outstanding old British spy series  The Sandbaggers  at Netflix when this book came over the transom  The author  Charles Gidley Wheeler  coincidentally wrote a later episode in the series  My Name is Anna Wiseman  one that was less brutal and mercenary than the typical entry but betrayed a deep moral seriousness at a time when such was not fashionable in the West (it was shown on June 30  1980)  Mr  Wheeler -- like the creator of The Sandbaggers  Ian Mackintosh -- is a former officer in the Royal Navy and in this novel he builds his story towards what was  paradoxically  both one of the pivotal moments in the decline of British global power and a little remembered event  the mass mutiny of the Atlantic Fleet at Invergordon in September 1931 though the immediate cause of the mutiny was a Depression era pay cut  Mr  Wheeler shows that the men had many other grievances that had built up over the years until such unrest was almost inevitable The novel provides perspective on the Navy and these events through the characters of Frank Jannaway  a servant's son in the household of retired naval officer Jervis Yarrow  whose son  Roddy  brutalizes Frank and whose daughter  Anita  is infatuated with him  Jannaway is a bright boy and shows promise on the piano  so Mr  Yarrow undertakes to pay for his schooling  Roddy is a conniving and thoroughly rotten young man who eventually uses Anita's indiscretions to get Frank thrown out of school and the house and into the Navy as an enlisted man  Meanwhile  Roddy's father gets him out of one scrape after another and advances him far beyond his abilities as a Naval officer  Frank and Anita are reunited years later and begin a love affair that is fated to end tragically  but not as tragically as the reunion of Frank and Roddy aboard HMS Winchester in 1931 Mr  Wheeler's tale is very dark  marching from one unpleasantness to the next  and the characters  other than Frank Jannaway himself  are generally rather unlikable  But it's a brisk and quite readable book and the history of the mutiny is fascinating   and the characters  other than Frank Jannaway himself  are generally rather unlikable  But it's a brisk and quite readable book and the history of the mutiny is fascinating 
If the classic British mystery seemed to take place entirely in the drawing room of a stately country manor and the classic American one involved a hard-boiled private eye working entirely on his own  the formula he crafted took an entire squad of detectives and set them down on the streets of a tough city -- the fictional Isola standing in for his own New York  His books seemed more realistic because the cops were more recognizably like us  with girlfriends  wives  and families and problems with bureaucratic politics  His large cast of regulars allowed him to develop multiple storylines and to shift his focus around the station house  To the extent that there was a central figure it would have to be Steve Carella  earnest  morally centered  with a deaf wife  Teddy Carella is on the case here  partnered with Bert Kling  who's been the naive junior member of the team for half a century now  But pride of place is given to Detective Oliver Wendell Weeks  the   "Fat Ollie  " of the title  Part of the delight of the books is that over time they've become completely anachronistic  Mr  McBain kept writing his characters as he'd invented them  but let the background events reflect the present day  So 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan are frequent touchpoints in the story but Fat Ollie is like Archie Bunker before Norman Lear got ahold of him  The idea that a cop could get away in the year 2002 with being as vociferously racist  sexist  and homophobic as Weeks has remained is obviously ludicrous  However  it's quite amusing to watch him cut a swathe through politically correct times The mystery involves the shooting death of a city councilmen who was about to declare for mayor and the theft of the novel that Fat Ollie had just finished  The murder is pretty stock stuff  but the police author plot gives Mr  McBain an opportunity to riff on the very genre he invented and wield a rather poison pen  At one point Ollie meets yet another cop who's written a novel of his own That's what we need  all right  Ollie thought  Another novel about police work  There used to be no novels about police work at all  Then  all of a sudden -- God knows who or what the influence might have been -- every sh[odd]y town in America had a fictitious character working out of a detective squadroom  To look at all these police novels out there  you'd think every hamlet in America was overrun with crime  Dumb little village has a population of six hundred people  according to these novels there are murders being committed there every hour on the hour Even as it drips with a fair amount of bitterness -- Mr  McBain even wanted to sue the creators of Hill Street Blues for pilfering his ideas -- that's awfully funny stuff  Doing things like dropping in such metafictional discourse earned the later books a reputation for greater ambition  but the older  more straightforward entries are even more enjoyable ovel of his own   That's what we need  all right  Ollie thought  Another novel about police work  There used to be no novels about police work at all  Then  all of a sudden -- God knows who or what the influence might have been -- every sh[odd]y town in America had a fictitious character working out of a detective squadroom  To look at all these police novels out there  you'd think every hamlet in America was overrun with crime  Dumb little village has a population of six hundred people  according to these novels there are murders being committed there every hour on the hour   Even as it drips with a fair amount of bitterness -- Mr  McBain even wanted to sue the creators of Hill Street Blues for pilfering his ideas -- that's awfully funny stuff  Doing things like dropping in such metafictional discourse earned the later books a reputation for greater ambition  but the older  more straightforward entries are even more enjoyable 
There's no end of subjects about which I believe--whether rightly or wrongly--that I know at least a little something  But  there's no subject about which I make less pretense to comprehension than women in general and young women in particular  Indeed  a mother  a sister  a wife  and a daughter have done little more than confuse the issue so thoroughly that I long ago gave up trying to figure them out  So I'm profoundly unqualified to judge the accuracy of Ms Skolkin-Smith's portrayal of a 14-year old American girl's coming-of-age in early 1960's Jerusalem  Liana Bialik's mother has brought her and her sister back to Israel  from Westchester County  NY  after the suicide of their father  There they are surrounded by the mother's past -- helping the Haganah to win Israeli independence from the British -- and by the mystery of the much-disputed ancient city  Becoming an adult is never a simple matter  but for Liana it's made no easier by the smothering affection and odd character of her mother nor the tense geo-political setting in which she finds herself My mother was in her element here  I thought  it was Israel and hot  Maybe she could be happy here  not need me so much  She could wear her tent dresses  and walk barelegged  with her kerchiefs tied around her neck  She could decide dressing any morning that she was not in need of underpants  or any other undergarment  No one would care or judge her as they did in Katonah The setting sun was a broad  magnified flame  widening and  staring outward towards the distant field and woods  I slowly summed up all the other obstacles in my way to going to Paris  my mother  the stifling  coarse country that would watch everything I did as if we were in a police state somewhere  the fact that I had no more than a hundred dollars and a few lira saved  and beyond the garden  the small pine forest and few Jewish houses  raw barbed wire made it impossible to skip off the property  and then go up further towards the Jordanian hills  And even though the wire was old now and weather-eaten  there were buried mines in the field beyond it The story of how Liana escapes this claustrophobic atmosphere and navigates those figurative and literal minefields scared the bejeebies out of me as a dad  but makes for a good moody read  Ms Skolkin-Smith does an especially nice job of evoking a Jerusalem where   "the war  " was still the triumphal one for statehood and the future seemed full of promise  even if looking back we can better discern the shapes of the shadows that lurk in the city streets towards the Jordanian hills  And even though the wire was old now and weather-eaten  there were buried mines in the field beyond it   The story of how Liana escapes this claustrophobic atmosphere and navigates those figurative and literal minefields scared the bejeebies out of me as a dad  but makes for a good moody read  Ms Skolkin-Smith does an especially nice job of evoking a Jerusalem where   "the war  " was still the triumphal one for statehood and the future seemed full of promise  even if looking back we can better discern the shapes of the shadows that lurk in the city streets 
If there's obviously something self-serving about the co-founder and CEO of Levenger --   "offering tools for the serious reader  " -- writing a book telling us to find ways to read more books  there's also something quite infectious about the enthusiasm Mr  Leveen  a born-again reader  brings to his little guide  Along the way he offers intelligent discussion of questions like what to read  whether to write in your books  and so forth  but mostly he encourages you to read and  importantly  listen to books  to make room for them in your life  no matter how busy It's good that the book is brief  because he very intentionally makes you want to put his down and move on to a classic  but two topics he might have touched on are finding books and picking versions of books  For the true bibliophile there's no better way to spend a Saturday than prowling through the book sales that almost every public library in America hosts  and many a church  retirement home  and college  The quality and condition varies wildly  but they're generally cheap and plentiful and there are always treasures lurking  The version of a book you buy can be important because they too vary so much  As John Nesbitt pointed out years ago in Megatrends  books will survive the electronic age because we enjoy the tactile sensation associated with them  Buy books that feel good in your hands and appeal to the eye  As I've gotten older I've found that means larger paperbacks instead of pocket size -- or even hardcovers if they're affordable (which those book sales we mentioned certainly help with) -- and books with larger type (though not Large Type) whenever possible  Never mind your eyesight and your age  it's just easier to read books with bigger print when you're not sure where you'll be reading  a plane  a waiting room  an easy chair but with a squirming kid in your lap  etc   Especially when you're reading the classics  it's also worthwhile to look for editions with interesting introductory or biographical essays or even end notes and footnotes  And be sure that if the original was in a foreign language that the edition you buy is a good translation  which can make all the difference in the world as to whether you enjoy the book or not  For instance  the Modern Library is publishing a very nice series of classics  one of which I found recently is Stendahl's The Red and the Black translated by the great Burton Raffel  I've always gotten bogged down in older translations of the book  but as it Mr  Raffel who rendered the version of Don Quijote that I finally appreciated  I look forward to giving Stendahl another shot  Add in the intro by Diane Johnson  the uniformly handsome presentation the publisher gives the books  and the ridiculously low price  and you've got a must Mr  Leveen does share one anecdote that both discusses the quality of the edition you buy and captures his love of books; perhaps we'll close with it On a trip to Amherst  Massachusetts  Lori and I toured Emily Dickinson's home  I bought a nice hardcover volume of her poetry in the gift shop and inside it wrote the date that we bought it  then taped in the ticket stub from the tour  Walking in Dickinson's yard with Lori that lovely summer afternoon  I picked up a perfect oak leaf from the grass and put that inside  too  Now our book is not simply any copy of Emily Dickinson's poetry  but a special one with particulars  and even a leaf from the very yard that inspired her Doesn't that make you want to grab a book that matters to you and start reading?or biographical essays or even end notes and footnotes  And be sure that if the original was in a foreign language that the edition you buy is a good translation  which can make all the difference in the world as to whether you enjoy the book or not  For instance  the Modern Library is publishing a very nice series of classics  one of which I found recently is Stendahl's The Red and the Black translated by the great Burton Raffel  I've always gotten bogged down in older translations of the book  but as it Mr  Raffel who rendered the version of Don Quijote that I finally appreciated  I look forward to giving Stendahl another shot  Add in the intro by Diane Johnson  the uniformly handsome presentation the publisher gives the books  and the ridiculously low price  and you've got a must   Mr  Leveen does share one anecdote that both discusses the quality of the edition you buy and captures his love of books;

Though the subtitle suggests that great comedy teams lasted at least into the 70s-80s and the cover's inclusion of a couple characters from &lt;u>Friends&lt;/u> would suggest they lasted in the 90s-00s  the reality is that they were pretty much through by the end of the 50s  but what a run they had   Though the heyday of the teams came in vaudeville  Golden Age movies  and early television  those of us in the Baby Boom generation -- especially those of us born later on  who grew up with television -- were probably more thoroughly exposed than any other demographic group and seem most likely to love this book  We got to watch The Little Rascals  Three Stooges  I Love Lucy  The Honeymooners  and even Amos 'n Andy in syndication every afternoon when we got home from school   Abbot and Costello was a Sunday morning staple and Laurel and Hardy  the Marx Brothers  and Hope and Crosby's Road movies made perfect cheap filler for non-network broadcast stations  There were enough variety shows still going that older teams and solo comedians would still show up from time to time  We may not have gotten all the jokes  but we spent an awful lot of time laughing at their varied antics  In &lt;u>Mixed Nuts&lt;/u> Lawrence J  Epstein treats us not just to a history of these acts but a sociological dissertation on American humor   The anecdote and joke-filled history  though brisk and though it extends several decades too far  is informative and fun  but it's the context he adds that makes the book fascinating No one will agree with all his analyses  and sometimes he's obviously reaching in order to give comedy acts a significance they just don't warrant  but the text is so rich in ideas and so thought-provoking that the few misfires are easily forgiven  Consider  for example  this discussion of George Burns and Gracie Allen [C]omic timing was a crucial part of their professional craft  In comedy  the straight man's   "timing  " refers to his ability to wait to speak until the laughter has peaked  receded  and finally stopped so that audiences can hear the next line  but not wait for so long after it has stopped that audiences might get confused or bored  The comic's timing refers to the response after the straight man has finished a line  The term   "beat  " is used to measure the pause between lines  and it and the   "pace   " or speed of the delivery  had to be perfect  The comic in the team needed an appropriate appearance and funny lines  Both the straight man and the comic needed rhythm Burns and Allen were experts at all of this  They knew which words to emphasize  They learned to control their voices  The staccato rhythm of their delivery was perfect  Other performers would have spoken too slowly or too fast or fallen out of the rhythm  which had to be maintained with each line and each silence  They even used pauses well  Gracie would giggle  an infectious sound and a prompt for even further audience laughter  George's repetition of much of the material was also crucial to the pacing  allowing the audience to grasp the premise precisely and be set up by George for the line to follow  It was impossible for Burns to be a comedian in such a structure  Any joke he interjected would break the patented Burns and Allen patter Note how deftly he establishes the general concepts he'll need throughout the book  but illustrates with a specific team  describing what made them masters of the form Likewise  here he discusses an irony that I've always found especially delicious  that two of the most conservative men in Hollywood politically were also the great innovators of post-modernism  years before academics and intellectuals imagined they were inventing a new phenomena Beyond creating an alternative to classic teams  Hope and Crosby signaled the decline of the traditional comedy team in two ways  First  they helped erase the line between the two worlds created by classic comedy teams They developed the fourth and final model of the relationship between reality and the comic world created by teams  which negated the three previous models developed by Burns and Allen  Laurel and Hardy  and Abbott and Costello  In this new model  there was no necessity for one member of a team to have a tenuous hold on reality while another character brought the team back to the real world  or for the team to create a fantasy world in which the team members banded together to overcome a strange  hostile reality represented by an outside straight man  or a team in which a straight man represented a tricky world seeking to con us Hope and Crosby developed a realistic humor that mocked the illusory world their movie producers had arranged for them  [   ][I]f you didn't take the real world too seriously there was no great need to create a fantasy comic world  Such an approach required a lack of sentimentality  an ability to avoid so strong an attachment to any person or place that you couldn't face the inevitable disappointments inherent in those people and places The earlier portion of that is bang on  but by the end seems quite wrong   Rather it is precisely because we are realistic about the inevitability of being disappointed by people and places that we can find the disappointments comic when they come  rather than tragic   Therein lies the secret to the notion that all comedy is conservative Let's end with one more  a look at Ralph Kramden that let's us see The Honeymooners in an almost religious context The character goes through a transformation in each show --  but then returns to his old form for the next show  only to be transformed again  Audiences wanted to see that transformation -- that change from the angry loser  the guy with a thousand get-rich ideas that all fail  that yells at his wife and his neighbor  that never seems to get ahead -- to the Chaplin-like  sad and sympathetic soul who is touched by love and  in Gleason's view  by grace and somehow finds the means to express it  As an episode was about to close  he often gazed lovingly at his wife and said    "Alice  you're the greatest   "Audiences saw in Ralph's transformation hopes for redemption in their own marriages and lives That's good stuff   Even if you disagree you're forced to grapple with what you think is wrong about it  an edifying exercise in itself   I suspect though that as you read you'll find more you agree with than disagree  and while it would have been better to end the story before we get to the point of considering Rowan and Martin and Cheech and Chong to be peers of the greats  all of it worthwhile created by classic comedy teams  They developed the fourth and final model of the relationship between reality and the comic world created by teams  which

Dr  Robert Zubrin is an aerospace engineer and one of the leading experts on and advocates for manned Mars missions  He's written hundreds of technical papers and several books on Mars exploration  testified before Congress and founded the Mars Society  He'd seem to have a pretty full plate  But over the past couple years he's turned his hand to fiction and now bids fair to become a Renaissance man Mr  Zubrin first fictional turn was  not surprisingly  a science fiction novel  First Landing  about a trip to Mars  It sported cover blurbs from the likes of Kevin J  Anderson  Kim Stanley Robinson and Gregory Benford and got good reviews  For his next effort he stuck to science fiction  but departed quite radically from the subject of Mars  The Holy Land is a delicious dystopic satire that does to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict what Orwell did to the Russian Revolution  If the topic was unexpected  even less predictable was the deft touch he demonstrated for comedy  You couldn't help but admire the courage and skill with which he exposed the inherent absurdity of such a deadly serious situation This time around Dr  Zubrin has been even more adventurous  offering up not just a tale of the American Revolution and the archetypal traitor but he's rendered it as a play to boot  The tragedy of Benedict Arnold has always fascinated--a genuine hero of the revolution for his roles at Fort Ticonderoga  Saratoga  and the assault on Quebec who  physically wounded in combat and psychologically embittered after quarreling with the Continental Congress about rank and money  eventually tried to surrender West Point and George Washington and his staff to the British  The plot was foiled when Arnold's British   "controller   " Major John Andre  was captured with incriminating plans on his person  Arnold defected to the British and served them ably fighting against the Americans  but Andre was hanged Dr  Zubrin does take some liberties with history  mostly for purposes of sketching in the various characters' motivations  He makes Peggy Shippen the key to the whole affair  A friend of Andre's in real life  Dr  Zubrin makes her Andre's paramour and a devoted Loyalist  her marriage to Arnold little more than part of a grand nefarious scheme  In addition  Andre is at least implied to have been General Henry Clinton's lover as well as his chief of intelligence--he was certainly closer to the difficult Clinton than most  Arnold  meanwhile  is played as a man insecure about his modest social background --Shippen refers to him contemptuously as a drugstore   "clerk  " -- and strongly attracted to the more stylish and aristocratic   "Tory Girls  " than the homier and homelier   "Patriot Girls   " Shippen and Andre use this and his disappointed ambition to ensnare him in the plot  Historical purists may be upset and  in truth  while some of these interpretations can at least find some support in the record others are pure speculation  Nonetheless  you do require some motives to drive the drama and Dr  Zubrin makes these serve well As always in a historical fiction characters are called upon to explain the setting and the events of the day  which can be pedantic and unnatural but is pretty much unavoidable  George Washington has a walk-on in which he's impossibly noble  except that we know of the instances where he acted just so in real life  There are a fair number of asides to the audience and it's not altogether clear how they'd work out on stage  but they do help reveal the internal thoughts of the dramatis personae  One nice touch is the presence of several period songs (though sadly not my favorite  Chester)  Best of all  Dr  Zubrin once again demonstrates a real facility with comedy  In particular  he gives Peggy Shippen such a sharp tongue that several of her comments are laugh out loud funny The leaders of the Revolution were themselves shaped to some considerable degree by works like Joseph Addison's tragedy  Cato  How fitting then of Dr  Zubrin to pay them tribute with a play of his own  It's delightful n to pay them tribute with a play of his own  It's delightful 
Several years ago Mark Kurlansky had a surprise bestseller with his book  &lt;a href=http //www amazon com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140298517/juddsbookreviews>The Basque History of the World&lt;/a>  in which he revealed the fascinating story of a people we'd come to associate only with terrorism in recent times  Jos&eacute; Maria Lacambra-Loizu  a native of the Basque region  has taken this rich history and turned it into an epic novel reminiscent of James A  Michener   Mr  Lacambra-Loizu accepts the version of the Basque past that holds they are directly descended from Cro-Magnon man--they do have a language and blood types that are unique--and follows as adventurous Ice Age bands trek from the Caucasus to their eventual homeland in northern Spain  in the Western Pyrenees  along the Bay of Biscay  Once settled they interact over the coming centuries with such historical figures as Julius Caesar  Charlemagne  Eleanor of Aquitaine  Richard the Lionheart  and  of course  the kings and queens of Spain and defend their chosen land against Celts  Romans  Franks  Moors and Spaniards The strengths and weaknesses of the book are much of a piece with Michener's works and any fan of his is likely to enjoy this one   Mr  Lacambra-Loizu uses the device of plunking down successive members of one family in the midst of the action   The format is necessarily episodic and just when you're getting to know the main character you're about to leave him behind  However  the goings on around them are so interesting as to make up for such quibbles  It's no coincidence though that the best portion of the book is an extended visit with Inaki  a young knight who ends up going Crusading in the Holy Land with Richard  is the most fully developed of the characters and his tale the most compelling overall  The best set piece is probably the defeat of Charlemagne in the pass of Roncesvalles  which later formed the basis of the poem  Chanson de Roland  though credit therein was given to the Moors rather than the Basques It's a longish book -- big enough to take to the beach this summer -- as befits its topic and the sweep of thousands of years   Still  it cuts off rather abruptly in and leaps ahead to the present  Presumably Mr  Lacambra-Loizu is working on a sequel  because there's plenty of Basque history still to be told and its recent past is just as event-filled  This fine effort will certainly get you started though e Moors rather than the Basques    It's a longish book -- big enough to take to the beach this summer -- as befits its topic and the sweep of thousands of years   Still  it cuts off rather abruptly in and leaps ahead to the present  Presumably Mr  Lacambra-Loizu is working on a sequel  because there's plenty of Basque history still to be told and its recent past is just as event-filled  This fine effort will certainly get you started though 
  "I was right  wasn't I  Joe? You should have been a private dick all the time  You're a natural  Here you've had a private op's license a full six hours or so  and you're working overtime finding dead bodies  disappearing potential murderers and witnesses  bumping heads with detective sergeants all over the place  You've got the knack  boy   "  -Goodey's Last StandThis seeming one-off private eye novel makes for a disorienting reading experience  Mr  Alverson so consciously tries to evoke Chandler that it's hard at first to figure out when the story is supposed to be set--though in the end it turns out to be contemporary  Adding to one's confusion is the anomaly of hero Joe Goodey referring to blacks as spades  which even in 1975 was frowned upon  At any rate  Goodey is thrown off of the San Francisco police department after accidentally shooting the mayor's uncle  but is given an expedited private eye's license when a stripper he knew turns up dead  with the mayor's name in her little black book  Set in Chinatown and the red light district the book's long on atmosphere and makes for a decent enough homage to the classics of the genre 
Considered solely as history or literature  the story of Christianity has an odd form to it  It's shaped something like an anaconda that ate a calf a few weeks ago  There's several thousand years of Jewish pre-history  then the brief span of Christ's birth  mission  crucifixion  and resurrection  then a couple thousand years of epilogue  After all  what--before or after--can compare with the story of the Savior?But if we take the longer view we begin to see just how remarkable the rest of the story is  Consider that at the time of the Crucifixion Christ was denied by even his own followers  a sect within an oppressed minority religion in a discrete portion of the mighty Roman Empire  Yet  from these rather inauspicious beginnings grew a religion of near 2 billion people  or one in three people in the world  For the believer this may have an air of inevitability--after all  how surprised can we be that the Word prevailed? However  even we must marvel that it spread so far  so fast  Here  surely  is a story worth telling Well  James D  Snyder details the years from A D  30-71 in a masterful narrative that follows the post-Christ missions of the Apostles against the backdrop (though it's often in the foreground) of a hostile Rome and equally hostile Judea  which were meanwhile in conflict one with the other  He weaves the three strands--Roman  Jewish  Christian--into one compelling tale that sweeps the reader through a pivotal  but easily overlooked  period in history  If the madness of Rome makes for disturbing but fascinating reading and the heroic struggle of the Jews proves ultimately futile  the successive martyrdoms of the Apostles pack an emotional punch  the climax  though not quite the end  of the book comes when Peter tries to escape from his captors in Rome but meets Christ on the road and asks  Domine  quo vadis? (  "Lord  where are you going?)   Jesus replied    "I am going to be crucified once again   "  Then Peter repeated himself    "Lord  you will be crucified again?  And Christ replied    "Yes  I will be crucified again   "    "Then  Lord   " answered Peter    "I am returning to follow you   "  No sooner had Peter turned around than Jesus vanished  After weeping and collecting his thoughts  Peter understood that the words were meant for his own martyrdom  that the Lord would suffer with him as he would all who lived and died in his name  And so  Peter  bursting with new strength  returned to the prison glorifying God and singing praises to the risen Christ  [   ]  It is said that Peter asked only one thing of his executioners    "I beg you crucify me in this way--head down--and no other way   " And he explained that he was not worthy to be executed as had his lord and master That's strong stuff and goes some way to explaining the survival and triumph of the Gospel We got no small number of self-published books through here and titles from smaller publishers  For the most part  even when they're worth reading you can see why a bigger house didn't pick them up  Not so with Mr  Snyder's fine book  I'm not familiar enough with Pharos Books to know what kind of distribution and publicity they could generate  But this is a text that belongs on your shelf along with the much more widely-known Pagans and Christians by Robin Lane Fox and The Barbarian Conversion  From Paganism to Christianity by Richard Fletcher  Taken together they carry the story of Christianity's rise from the First Century to the Fourteenth in immensely readable and enjoyable fashion Then Peter repeated himself    "Lord  you will be crucified again?      And Christ replied    "Yes  I will be crucified again   "        "Then  Lord   " answered Peter    "I am returning to follow you   "      No sooner had Peter turned around than Jesus vanished  After weeping and collecting his thoughts  Peter understood that the words were meant for his own martyrdom  that the Lord would suffer with him as he would all who lived and died in his name  And so  Peter  bursting with new strength  returned to the prison glorifying God and singing praises to the risen Christ  [   ]      It is said that Peter asked only one thing of his executioners    "I beg you crucify me in this way--head down--and no other way   " And he explained that he was not worthy to be executed as had his lord and master   That's strong stuff and goes some way to explaining the survival and triumph of the Gospel   We got no small number of self-published books through here and titles from smaller publishers  For the most part  even when they're worth reading you can see why a bigger house didn't pick them up  Not so with Mr  Snyder's fine book  I'm not familiar enough with Pharos Books to know what kind of distribution and publicity they could generate  But this is a text that belongs on your shelf along with the much more widely-known Pagans and Christians by Robin Lane Fox and The Barbarian Conversion  From Paganism to Christianity by Richard Fletcher  Taken together they carry the story of Christianity's rise from the First Century to the Fourteenth in immensely readable and enjoyable fashion 
Though the title of his book suggests the possibility of narrative sweep it is in fact a more modestly targeted effort  For the most part Mr  Ehrman treats the '80s as a transitional era  as America went from a failing industrial economy to the exuberant information economy of the '90s and from a near universal acceptance of liberal New Deal/Great Society orthodoxy to the widespread belief  even among Third Way Democrats  in conservative approaches to social problems and the use of free market solutions to provide social services and fuel economic growth  Combined with for the most part ignoring foreign affairs this enables him to take a more sober look at Ronald Reagan than do many of the reverent analysts on the Right and the hysterical critics on the Left  In our hyperpartisan era  such dispassion is somewhat refreshing  but it does seem to make Mr  Ehrman overly cautious in offering assessments  as if giving President Reagan much credit for anything would betray an unforgivable bias  Too often that leads to a certain sense in the book that the changes that took place in the '80s were inevitable and Mr  Reagan just happened to be in office while they went on around him  Surely there's a middle ground between claiming that the Gipper walked on water and pretending that a second Jimmy Carter term  would have been indistinguishable from Reagan's first?That said  there's one theme of the book that Mr  Ehrman handles especially well  a leitmotif that he traces through the decade to devastating effect  the complete failure of liberalism generally and the Democrats in particular to come to grips with the fact that conservatism was being re-established as a credible political philosophy in America  perhaps even its dominant one  Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill; Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd; presidential candidates Jimmy Carter  Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis; pundits and academics like Robert Reich  Lester Thurow  Paul Kennedy  and Arthur Schlesinger  Jr ;

Ask around a bit and you'll find no shortage of folks  men in particular  who became readers via their encounters in youth with class adventure tales  The Three Musketeers  The Count of Monte Cristo  Ivanhoe  the Lord of the Rings  etc  ask again and you'll find almost no one whose heard of half the Nobel Laureates in Literature  fewer who've read them  and none enjoyed many of them  All the more remarkable then that one of the great adventure authors of all time actually won a Nobel and somewhat tragic that so few have read him in recent decades  But Henryk Sienkiewicz has made something of a comeback and it could not be more welcome Sienkiewicz is the great author of Poland--indeed  to some extent his works are said to have created and helped to maintain the strong Polish identity that prevailed through the troubled 20th Century  When his books were first published -- mostly late in the 19th Century -- the English translations were done by Teddy Roosevelt's friend Jeremiah Curtin and  whether they were adequate for their time  they are are terribly dated now and have served to put off potential readers  Add in the fact that neither the Nazis nor the Communists had much interest in fostering Polish patriotism and you've the recipe for lost classics  But then  fittingly as the Iron Curtain was crumbling  Hippocrene Books commissioned a new translation of his greatest works  The Trilogy and Quo Vadis?  by the highly-regarded Polish novelist W  S  Kuniczak  and these eminently readable versions won Sienkiewicz a modern audience  New translations of other works followed  then a terrific film version of In Desert and Wilderness  and a massive Polish television adaptation of the Trilogy  Suddenly we've a surfeit of riches and some catching up to do If you're just starting out it might be wise to begin with Quo Vadis?  a stand alone tale of Christians in Rome that really deserves a fresh film treatment  But it's well worth your time to dive into the Trilogy  the first volume of which is the magnificent With Fire and Sword  Set in 1647  amidst a Cossack uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  it tells the story of a young Polish patriot and hero  Yan Skshetuski  and his love for the beautiful Helen  who is also coveted the brutal Bohun  who fights with the rebels  Pan Yan's twin tales give us epic history and grand romance  while his compatriots offer comic relief  There's his wily servant  Zjendjan  whose semi-faithful service somehow keeps lining his own pocket  There's the mopey giant Pan Longinus  who has sworn a vow of chastity until he lives up to the example of his forebears and takes off the heads of three enemy soldiers with one swing of his massive battle sword  There's Pan Michal Wolodyjowski  whose bravery and feistiness belie his diminutive stature  And  best of all  there's the Falstaffian Pan Zagloba  who makes up in drinking capacity  gluttony  and biting wit what he lacks in zeal for battle  as he keeps his one good eye peeled for threats to his corpulent frame It'll take you a hundred to a hundred and fifty pages to orient yourself and get used to the odd names and nicknames  but the subsequent thousand pages go by far too fast  It's one of those stories you don't ever want to end o the Trilogy  the first volume of which is the magnificent With Fire and Sword  Set in 1647  amidst a Cossack uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  it tells the story of a young Polish patriot and hero  Yan Skshetuski  and his love for the beautiful Helen  who is also coveted the brutal Bohun  who fights with the rebels  Pan Yan's twin tales give us epic history and grand romance  while his compatriots offer comic relief  There's his wily servant  Zjendjan  whose semi-faithful service somehow keeps lining his own pocket  There's the mopey giant Pan Longinus  who has sworn a vow of chastity until he lives up to the example of his forebears and takes off the heads of three enemy soldiers with one swing of his massive battle sword  There's Pan Michal Wolodyjowski  whose bravery and feistiness belie his diminutive stature  And  best of all  there's the Falstaffian Pan Zagloba  who makes up in drinking capacity  gluttony  and biting wit what he lacks in zeal for battle  as he keeps his one good eye peeled for threats to his corpulent frame   It'll take you a hundred to a hundred and fifty pages to orient yourself and get used to the odd names and nicknames  but the subsequent thousand pages go by far too fast  It's one of those stories you don't ever want to end 
If this book were a historical novel--say by someone like Gary Jennings--you'd say the author had gone so far overboard in piling up incidents that he strained credulity  That makes it all the more remarkable that Mr  McCalman's is a work of non-fiction  Giuseppe Balsamo  Count Cagliostro (1743-95) led a life filled with love affairs  cons  duels  frauds  pimping  scandals  encounters with the famous and infamous  and shrouded it all in so much mystery--especially Masonic mythology--that it has invited artists from Mozart to Dumas to Goethe to William Blake to Umberto Eco draw upon it for their works  But as this fascinating narrative biography amply demonstrates the topic is nowhere near exhausted You can get some sense of Cagliostro's intriguing multiple personalities just from the chapter titles--Freemason; Necromancer; Shaman; Copt; Prophet; Rejuvenator; Heretic--and the Epilogue  appropriately subtitled  Immortal  As the chapters suggest  to some degree  Cagliostro represents the persistence of the supernatural and mystical at the very center of the Age of Reason  Stripped down to essentials that can't possibly begin to do the story justice  Giuseppe Balsamo was low born in Sicily  but styling himself Count Cagliostro  loaning out his beguiling wife  Seraphina  and claiming magical healing powers and both a legitimate background in Freemasonry and a bogus one in an occult Egyptian-rite Freemasonry was able to gain entree to the best social circles in Europe  though he proceeded to be chased from Russia by Catherine the Great  imprisoned in the Bastille by Louis XVI over the notorious   "Affair of the Necklace   " and died in the prison he'd been sent to by the Inquisition  If all of that sounds entertaining be assured that Mr  McCalman makes it very much so However  in the end there's a dark side to the tale too  for the author convincingly argues that Cagliostro did much to make possible the myriad conspiracy theories that did so much damage to Europe in the ensuing decades and some of which persist to this day  Mr  McCalman notes that  on the one hand  popular writers conflated him into the mythical Wandering Jew and made him   "a fashionably moody and anguished rebel  tilting against oppressions of the spirit  " while  on the other  his presence lurks behind many of the delusions about Masons and Illuminati secretly controlling the world and says     "It would be unfair to blame Cagliostro for the actions of mythologizers  but Umberto Eco has shown that the idea of Masonic conspiracy has borne some terrible fruit  During the early twentieth  Jews rather than Masons became the prime target  By the time it reached a bitter young man in Vienna called Adolph Hitler  the idea had taken a new and monstrous shape  Templars  Illuminati  and Egyptian Masons had given way to the Protocols of Zion  the Twelve Tribes of Israel  and the world conspiracy of Judaism  Whatever one may think of Cagliostro  it is devastating to think that he was in some way a conduit of the Holocaust   "Even after we grant that some of that is simply an author stretching his subject a tad thin to make him seem more relevant than he might in reality be  it still tells us something  as does Cagliostro's whole career  about the disturbing credulousness that fits so comfortably with modernity's claim to have escaped the superstitions of religion for the bright new world of Reason  The interplay of this theme with Cagliostro's extraordinary life and Mr  McCalman's accessible story-telling makes for an eminently readable and often thought-provoking book damage to Europe in the ensuing decades and some of which persist to this day  Mr  McCalman notes that  on the one hand  popular writers conflated him into the mythical Wandering Jew and made him   "a fashionably moody and anguished rebel  tilting against oppressions of the spirit  " while  on the other  his presence lurks behind many of the delusions about Masons and Illuminati secretly controlling the world and says         "It would be unfair to blame Cagliostro for the actions of mythologizers  but Umberto Eco has shown that the idea of Masonic conspiracy has borne some terrible fruit  During the early twentieth  Jews rather than Masons became the prime target  By the time it reached a bitter young man in Vienna called Adolph Hitler  the idea had taken a new and monstrous shape  Templars  Illuminati  and Egyptian Masons had given way to the Protocols of Zion  the Twelve Tribes of Israel  and the world conspiracy of Judaism  Whatever one may think of Cagliostro  it is devastating to think that he was in some way a conduit of the Holocaust   "  Even after we grant that some of that is simply an author stretching his subject a tad thin to make him seem more relevant than he might in reality be  it still tells us something  as does Cagliostro's whole career  about the disturbing credulousness that fits so comfortably with modernity's claim to have escaped the superstitions of religion for the bright new world of Reason  The interplay of this theme with Cagliostro's extraordinary life and Mr  McCalman's accessible story-telling makes for an eminently readable and often thought-provoking book 
Leave us start with two admissions and a warning  First  I know the author of this volume  Brian C  Anderson  in the way we now know one another in the Internet Age  and so am not an impartial source as regards his book  A couple years ago he was one of the first editors to contact us and suggest that we blog about stories from his fine publication  City Journal  This struck us then as a very smart use of a relatively new instrumentality to create buzz for a magazine that deserved it  That there are still major newspapers and other publications that haven't figured out the benefits they could reap from having folks steer readers to them for free only makes Mr  Anderson seem further ahead of the curve  In addition  his own essays are uniformly excellent and one  We're Not Losing the Culture Wars Anymore (Brian C  Anderson  Autumn 2003  City Journal)  was one of the best pieces of recent years on the rise of a conservative media counter-culture  When he decided to expand on that essay in this book it really couldn't help but be a good read and I didn't approach it with anything like an open mind  nevermind skepticism  Just so you know Second  despite my anticipation  I did feel some trepidation at the subtitle  with its prominent mention of   "liberal media bias   " Let's face it  while they served their purpose well  we don't much need another diatribe about the distortions and dominance of the liberal media  That one's been done to death  Likewise  the boxing-gloved Kapow! graphic on the cover raised some concern that Mr  Anderson might have fallen prey to the triumphalism that plagues so many on the Internet  who think they've already outdone Gutenberg in terms of the impact of their medium on society  After all  tripping up a few lightweights like Trent Lott  Dan Rather  Jayson Blair  and Jeff Gannon doesn't quite equal being a driving force behind literacy and the Reformation  Happily  Mr  Anderson seems to have been well aware of these potential pitfalls himself  After some introductory remarks  he accepts the liberal media as a given and doesn't squander space dwelling on it  Nor does he so much as suggest that the Right has managed to balance out that bias in recent years  The book is about the revolt against said  but it is very much about a revolt in progress  If new media are providing conservatism with a greater voice in the public square  we're nonetheless still closer to Bunker Hill than to Yorktown As to the warning  I'd not anticipated just how funny the book would be  In addition to hilarious scenes from South Park itself  Mr  Anderson draws upon the work of Dennis Miller  Scott Ott  Chris Muir  and a host of others--not all of whom would be considered classically conservative--who are using comedy to puncture the pretensions of liberalism  Thus the caution--some of these bits are so funny that your spouse will insist you let him/her read them immediately  and it can be hard to get the book back Mr  Anderson's thesis is straightforward enough and seemingly incontrovertible--that the Right  which had been shut out of the mainstream media for decades  has mounted a successful insurgency on talk radio  cable television  college campuses  and the Internet (especially the blogosphere) that has given it a much stronger voice in the Culture War than it had before  The warfare remains asymmetrical--the Left  after all  has all three nightly network newscasts and nearly all the major metropolitan dailies  while the Right has only FOX News  the Washington Times  and alternative news services like World Net Daily--but the trends are promising and the free market in particular is a powerful force working in favor of conservatism  Media executives may not care for conservative ideas but they can't ignore things like the popularity of the wildly anti-PC South Park  the success FOX has had largely at CNN's expense  or the fact that Mel Gibson's Passion  which most in Hollywood wouldn't touch  turned out to be a blockbuster  In a country that is divided at least 50/50 between conservatives and liberals  it makes no sense from a purely business standpoint to leave half the consumers unserved  The revolt would appear to have even better days before it The book offers a fascinating history of the rise of these more conservative media outlets  For instance  Mr  Anderson explains the importance of Ronald Reagan dispensing with the FCC's   "Fairness Doctrine  " and the ensuing ascent to prominence of Rush Limbaugh  a figure who he's not uncritical of but does give a central role in the revolt  Who better represents the emergence of a powerful conservative critique in the media than Mr  Limbaugh  who went from being heard on one radio station in Sacramento to generating over $1 billion in revenues on a nationwide network of 600 affiliates with 20 million listeners? Perhaps we can borrow a metaphor Mr  Anderson uses in particular circumstances to describe the entire process he depicts  from rather small beginnings  conservative media has become like   "samizdat multiplied by orders of magnitude   "I do have two quarrels with the book  though neither fatal  As good a job as he does laying out the history of the revolt thus far  Mr  Anderson concludes a bit brusquely  I'd have liked to have him talk a bit more about where he thinks it's all headed and what the import will be  He touches on such questions as he goes along  but a summing up would have been helpful  More than that though  the book could use a more extensive discussion of just why it is that humor is proving such a fertile field for the Right and why liberalism seems unable to contest that ground  He offers a tantalizing clue in passing  but never returns to it   [T]here's no doubting South Park  joining a long tradition that runs from Aristophanes to Tom Wolfe  exemplifies the essence of satire--  "the comic as weapon   " as social thinker Peter Berger describes it in his book on the comic imagination  Satire  Berger writes  has four criteria  fantasy (often grotesque)  a firm moral standpoint  an object of attack  and an educational purpose  South Park meets all four Merely the idea that satire must proceed from a   "firm moral standpoint  " suggests something of why the Right is able to make such good use of it and the tolerant/moral relativist Left isn't  Consider too the old aphorism that  to a liberal the world is a tragedy  to a conservative a comedy  The grotesque nature of satire will then be humorous to the Right while it will offend the Left to be asked to laugh at the travails of others  a violation of the political-correctness that holds we can find nothing funny in the human condition  There's rich territory here  Indeed  even liberals have noted the Left/Right humor gap--Bubble Wrap  The Nation vs  The Weekly Standard (John Powers  8/30/02  LA Weekly)--and we've argued that All Humor is Conservative  Mr  Anderson needn't have gone to that extreme  but the role of comedy is so central to the revolution he writes about that it would have been well worth his while to address it in some greater depth Such quibbles are picayune though when set against the book he did write  which manages to be both informative and funny  Not only should you get one for yourself but get one for your significant other too--so you can read and laugh together ch  turned out to be a blockbuster  In a country that is divided at least 50/50 between conservatives and liberals  it makes no sense from a purely business standpoint to leave half the consumers unserved  The revolt would appear to have even better days before it   The book offers a fascinating history of the rise of these more conservative media outlets  For instance  Mr  Anderson explains the importance of Ronald Reagan dispensing with the FCC's   "Fairness Doctrine  " and the ensuing ascent to prominence of Rush Limbaugh  a figure who he's not uncritical of but does give a central role in the revolt  Who better represents the emergence of a powerful conservative critique in the media than Mr  Limbaugh  who went from being heard on one radio station in Sacramento to generating over $1 billion in revenues on a nationwide network of 600 affiliates with 20 million listeners?

When Saul Bellow's novel Ravelstein came out there was not only no doubt that it was a roman a clef but folk had little trouble discerning who many of the characters were  not least Ravelstein himself  the late Allan Bloom  Comes Robert Howse to tread what seems to be some of the same ground -- including a protagonist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Mr  Bellow -- but  notwithstanding the author's obligatory disclaimer that all is fiction  I'm not sure how much of this we're supposed to connect to reality and how much is supposed to stand on its own  Matters are hardly helped by the fact that Mr  Rowse was a student of both Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom  The book is diverting enough in its own right  but leaves a gnawing feeling that in-jokes are slipping by we unwashed The story takes Arthur Rizler  a Toronto-born novelist who enjoyed considerable success at mid-century  to post-communist Prague  where he is to deliver a lecture on Mozart  Accompanying him is his fourth wife  Maya  who is half his age and far more invested in the remains of his renown than he seems to be  Hot on their heels are Midge Svobodnik  Maya's mother who is bent on her daughter ditching Rizler so she can get on with having children  and Jeremy Stuart --   "a freelance agent of global capitalism and democracy  a citizen of the world  and much in demand as a speechwriter  an adviser  a behind-the-scenes-man  transnational troubleshooter  " -- who is romantically obsessed with Maya  As the setting and the description of Jeremy suggest  one of Mr  Howse's main topics here is the triumphalist moment at the end of the Cold War when neoconservatism was in its first blush of glory and there was an easy buck to be made off of both explaining and implementing its ideas  He casts a somewhat dubious eye on the phenomenon of globalization and the notion of the End of History  referring wittily to CNN as   "Fukuyama Vision  " and saying of Maya   Whatever wavering in her feelings about Rizler as a husband  she had never doubted for a moment that he was one of the few living human figures who had any capacity to make the human condition more tolerable  to combat the forces of darkness  Rizler was still  and would always be her world historical mission That's a nice dig at the notion of the intellectual as Hegelian superhero  never mind the hero's latest trophy Mr  Howse calls his book a farce  though it seems all too probable  especially when it ends with an event that has a distinct parallel in reality  Whatever the reader ends up classing it in  the book is dryly funny and an enjoyable read eelings about Rizler as a husband  she had never doubted for a moment that he was one of the few living human figures who had any capacity to make the human condition more tolerable  to combat the forces of darkness  Rizler was still  and would always be her world historical mission   That's a nice dig at the notion of the intellectual as Hegelian superhero  never mind the hero's latest trophy   Mr  Howse calls his book a farce  though it seems all too probable  especially when it ends with an event that has a distinct parallel in reality  Whatever the reader ends up classing it in  the book is dryly funny and an enjoyable read 
Jim Black's warm and wonderful first novel tells the story of a boyhood summer in Archer City  Texas in 1966  It takes its place proudly on the continuum of American classics of youth between Huckleberry Finn  with which it shares the dynamic of a friendship between a white boy and a black man  and the magic-tinged books of Ray Bradbury--Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked This Way Comes--Robert McCammon-- Boy's Life--and Dan Simmons--Summer of Night  Thirteen-year-old Jim Black lost his alcoholic father in an accident but finds an unlikely--given the times--father figure in Samuel Joseph Washington  a former Negro League player who lives by the Little Wichita River where they both like to fish  Sam--whose beloved wife  Rose  is a devout Christian-- teaches Jim his own theory of life     "You see  it has just always felt to me like we're all floatin' in a big river   and the current's carryin' us along   some parts flowin' slow and easy--that's when times are good; and some parts are pretty rough--bad times for sure     "The way I see it  we're all sort of born into it  and after that  we're on our own  What I haven't figured out is why some folks seem to spend most of their lives in the rough water  I been there  that's for sure  And I reckon there are times when the current's just too strong to escape  But sometimes  I think you can swim out of it  if you want to bad enough and try hard enough  Sometimes  And I believe we're put here for a reason  And we're supposed to find that reason somewhere along the way   "Helping Jim to navigate the river that season are his fast friends Gary Wayne Beesinger and Charles Luig  Together they get into all kinds of often very funny mischief  enjoy adventures  suffer misadventures and learn lessons about coping with tragedy  unrequited love  racism  and the various vagaries of life Mr  Black treads lightly on the racial angle  which is a relief  since we might otherwise just end up with another sermon on the evils of the American South  Likewise  he give us hints that the magic and monsters of our youthful imaginations lurk in the background of the tale  but he doesn't yield to the temptation to veer into Stephen King territory  These two sensible decisions to make a final scene work far better than it might have otherwise  as Jim experiences what can only be called a miracle  and we buy into it completely  This is a delightful book that deserves a wide readership and will surely make a terrific film one day end up with another sermon on the evils of the American South  Likewise  he give us hints that the magic and monsters of our youthful imaginations lurk in the background of the tale  but he doesn't yield to the temptation to veer into Stephen King territory  These two sensible decisions to make a final scene work far better than it might have otherwise  as Jim experiences what can only be called a miracle  and we buy into it completely  This is a delightful book that deserves a wide readership and will surely make a terrific film one day 
Everyone I know who's read Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire considers it one of the best historical novels of all time--and  because it's the kind of book you force upon friends  that's just about every guy I know  When an author gives readers such a gift it seems only fair to give him some loyalty in return  So  although his newest seemed marred by a significant flaw  I kept reading Virtues of War  and that devotion was richly rewarded as in the end the seeming flaw turns out to be the point of the work and illustrates it beautifully Oliver Stone's better publicized new film  Alexander  has re-ignited an ago old controversy about the conqueror  did his conquests serve a purpose  spreading Greek Civilization eastwards  or was it simply a matter of conquest for conquest's sake  As Peter Green explained in a recent review essay in The New Republic     "Guy Griffith  my old ancient history teacher at Cambridge  is on record as holding it to be   "one of the paradoxes of history (and historiography)  " that despite Alexander's extraordinary career  which attracted so many writers  and despite the care that he devoted to the promotion of his own image  he   "should have been handed down finally in history as an enigma   " In the half-century or so since then  historians have cleared up the picture a good deal  and Cartledge's well-documented account reflects this progress  the profile that emerges is that of a military genius driven by an overwhelming obsession  a pothos  to pursue glory through conquest to the world's end  and take savage reprisals against any who thwarted his will while he was at it  Arrian was surely right  had Alexander lived    "he would not have stopped conquering even if he'd added Europe to Asia and the Britannic islands to Europe   " It is almost impossible to think of Alexander in old age  He remains a beacon  an icon  arrested in mid-career  a meteor streaking for all eternity toward an infinite future  The Greeks who cursed him as a barbarous killer in his lifetime  but over the millennia came to see him as the brightest torch-bearer of the Hellenic spirit  are proof enough of that   "There's obviously much a writer of fiction can do with such paradox  The easy way out  for a popular novelist in particular  would be to make Alexander a pleasing action hero and   "torch-bearer  " of culture  Mr  Pressfield though  to his great credit  takes the far harder route  giving us an Alexander who is a creature of his own selfish ambitions  This Alexander is an anti-hero  which presents challenges to the reader  because we are so disaffected from Alexander's long march of war  and for the author; but  for the reader who sticks with him  Mr  Pressfield offers real rewards The conceit of the novel is that Alexander has a demon  a   "daimon  " in Mr  Pressfield's parlance  which drives him onwards from brutal victory to brutal victory  a virtual being outside himself  preventing him from listening to his better angels  At first  when things are going well and fairly easily  with his army and his officers well-satisfied  the daimon is a relatively subdued presence  But as Alexander's appetite for new territory becomes insatiable and takes them farther and farther afield  until their wars can have only the most tangential relationship to security and interests of their Greek homelands  the army becomes increasingly restive  the commanders disgruntled  and Alexander less capable of holding back the daimon  which takes on the qualities of almost an alternate personality I'll try not to give up too much of the endgame  but  in a pivotal scene late in the novel  Alexander is introduced to a gymnosophist    "the 'naked wise men' of India  "     "This man has conquered the world! What have you done?  " The philosopher replied without an instant's hesitation    "I have conquered the need to conquer the world   "The indictment that Mr  Pressfield hands down is that the unknownIndian's feat is a greater conquest than any of Alexander's that the unknown Indian's feat is a greater conquest than any of Alexander's 
There are a lot of dates that every well educated person knows and  at some point  we actually learned what happened and why they were important   1492--Columbus sailed the ocean blue; 1620--Pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock; 1776--Declaration of Independence; 1929-Great Crash   There are also plenty of historic events that you think you know something about  but what you know is totally wrong (see my essay on David vs  Goliath)   But then there are those dates and names and phrases that you pick up as you go along without ever even having a mild clue what they mean or exactly what they reference   Here's one  1066   Yeah  I know   You recognize the year   You may even remember that it was the year of the Norman Invasion   If you got that far  you might remember that William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings and took over Britain   But I was a History major and I sure as heck couldn't tell you any of the details   Actually  I couldn't even remember who his opponent was and I sure couldn't remember why he had a claim to the throne So I was enormously intrigued when  several years ago now  I saw a reference to The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz as    "the greatest historical novel ever written  "   As is the way with such things  I promptly saw two or three other mentions of this book which I had previously never heard of before   I looked it up on Amazon and couldn't find it   I even tried Amazon UK  but no luck   Then one day at a local booksale  I found a copy   It still has most of the dust jacket intact and the cover blurbs are by the great British historian G M  Trevelyan and the novelist Vita Sackville-West   I don't know if Muntz knew him personally  I actually haven't been able to find any information about her  but her dedication is to Winston Churchill   All the bells and whistles are here; it seems like it must have been a significant book when it was published   I have no idea why it is out of print  (The link above will take you to a book dealer website where you can find copies ranging in price from a few dollars to $15 or $20 )  Now  after reading it  I am even more mystified First of all  the true historical material that Muntz had to work with is really interesting   As the story opens  King Edward the Confessor sits upon the throne of England   William (   )  of Normandy  has just helped him drive off Godwin and his sons   Godwin  a descendant of King Canute  is one of the most powerful noblemen in the land   His daughter Edith is Edward's Queen   Eventually  Godwin and his sons return and though Godwin dies  his son Harold appears likely to become king  as Edith has chosen to lead a cloistered life rather than produce an heir   Meanwhile  William lusts for the throne himself and rests his claim to it on a promise that Edward made years earlier   So it is Harold's great misfortune when he is shipwrecked on the coast of France and William secures possession of him   The two get along famously  but William will not release Harold until he promises to support William's claim to the throne upon Edward's death   Harold swears this oath and leaves his own brother as hostage   This infuriates his other brothers  upon his return to England  and is one of the precipitating factors in his eventual falling out with his hot headed brother Tosti When Edward dies (January 5  1066)  Harold  who is the most popular man in the kingdom  renounces his oath as having been secured under duress and he takes the throne   The Pope rules in William's favor and the Normans mount an invasion with Rome's blessing   Tosti  with the help of the Norwegian King Harald Sigurdson  attacks from the north and takes York   But Harold defeats them at the battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25th   He then has to wheel south  with a badly damaged army  and march to meet William   On October 14  1066  William deafeats him in the Battle of Hastings and becomes King of England The author does this storyproud   She wields a light hand in judging the motives and actions of the characters   Both Harold and William come across as great men   If we root for Harold  it is because he seems the better person and true patriot  even while he shares William's tremendous ambition   Muntz tells the story in episodes   Each chapter is headed Of    (Of Harold and Tosti  Of the Fight at Stamford Bridge  etc )  which  combined with judicious use of archaic language  conveys the feeling that one is reading one of the ancient sagas   She manages to retain the sense that this is fundamentally a tale that is close to a thousand years old  yet keep the telling modern enough to appeal to the contemporary reader This is a really fine novel (though probably not the best historical novel ever written) and will amply reward the effort necessary to seek it out in judging the motives and actions of the characters   Both Harold and William come across as great men   If we root for Harold  it is because he seems the better person and true patriot  even while he shares William's tremendous ambition   Muntz tells the story in episodes   Each chapter is headed Of    (Of Harold and Tosti  Of the Fight at Stamford Bridge  etc )  which  combined with judicious use of archaic language  conveys the feeling that one is reading one of the ancient sagas   She manages to retain the sense that this is fundamentally a tale that is close to a thousand years old  yet keep the telling modern enough to appeal to the contemporary reader     This is a really fine novel (though probably not the best historical novel ever written) and will amply reward the effort necessary to seek it out 
What George Orwell did for (or to?) the Russian Revolution in Animal Farm Robert Zubrin does to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict in this very clever satire  When the Western Galactic Empire relocates the unpopular race of Minervans to their original homeland in Kennewick  WA  the Americans take it poorly  The corrupt Christian fundamentalist administration in Washington  DC first tries to expel them using force  but when that fails they decide to make a play for galactic sympathy  so people are herded into &quot;refugee&quot; camps around the new Minervan land  to live in ostentatious misery  From these camps they launch suicidal terrorist assaults on the Minervans  Later  when the vital energy source helicity is discovered in America  the administration uses its wealth to set up training camps in far flung locales in order to have plausible deniability when it launches a spectacular 9-11-style attack on the Western Galactic Empire itself All of the elements of the conflict in our own Holy Lands are present here and there's great pleasure to be had in seeing how Mr  Zubrin draws the parallels  Likewise  the absurdity of these tactics is even clearer in a fictional setting than it is in real life  The Americans have no chance against the Minervans  who are decent folk and just want to live peacefully in the land that is rightfully theirs  The American political leaders cynically manipulate their own people and the galactic press and they engage in truly criminal behavior  But  something seemingly unintended does happen--even with the deck so stacked--this reader  at least  found his sympathies ultimately did lie with the Americans as against the Minervans  Sure  one would wish the leadership less corrupt and their means less vile  but tribalism/nativism is a powerful force and  in the end  it seems only natural to prefer Christian Americans who are rather similar to us  even if flawed  to the quite different Minervans  And  realistically  imagine that the Native Americans  who have a not un-Minervan claim to American soil  set up a state for themselves--how do you think we'd all react  no matter the abstract justice of their case?As I say  I'd assume this reaction is not what Mr  Zubrin intended  but in a way it makes the book even more powerful  Once you recognize that you can abhor your own leaders methods but still find their cause somewhat compelling  you gain a genuine insight into the insanity that has infected the Palestinians  This insight can in no way justify terrorism but does suggest why more moderate and ordinary people are reluctant to disavow the extremists in their midst e Americans  who have a not un-Minervan claim to American soil  set up a state for themselves--how do you think we'd all react  no matter the abstract justice of their case?As I say  I'd assume this reaction is not what Mr  Zubrin intended  but in a way it makes the book even more powerful  Once you recognize that you can abhor your own leaders methods but still find their cause somewhat compelling  you gain a genuine insight into the insanity that has infected the Palestinians  This insight can in no way justify terrorism but does suggest why more moderate and ordinary people are reluctant to disavow the extremists in their midst 
First a disclaimer  Ms Kohn is a neighbor and a friend--so some partiality is likely unavoidable in this review  That said  it was a considerable relief to open the pages of the book and find that no partisanship would be required to sing its praises  I read the first hundred pages in one gulp and was captivated  The story of Esther is one we know so well that we may cease to consider what it really means  Its characters are become so iconic we may forget they were human beings  Ms Kohn makes the story fresh and exciting  not least by expanding upon the character of Esther so that her actions are those of an engaging woman whose motivations we understand and whose courage we respect  Granting us a new look at the old tale  Ms Kohn makes us consider its lessons anew and they are as timely today as they were thousands of years ago The Biblical account of Esther is intact here  but Ms Kohn does take some liberties around it  For one thing  she has the young Jewish girl Haddasah initially betrothed to Mordechai  before being sent to the harem of King Xerxes  Mordechai himself has taken on the coloration of the court and of the worshippers of Ahura Mazda and urges the young Haddasah to  &quot;Let yourself be known only as Esther  foster daughter of Marduka the Babylonian &quot; Then the great bulk of the action occurs in the harem  The novel focuses on how Esther learns to wield political power within that closed world  which will serve her in good stead when she later needs to affect the wide world  She develops believable relationships with the other women  servants and eunuchs of the harem and Ms Kohn is particularly good at portraying the internal conflict that being Jewish and loving Mordechai causes Esther as she is forced to disguise her true religion and serve a king she does not love I could eat the food of the harem  I could submit myself to the authority of a eunuch  I could go in to the king as a virgin and return to the harem as a harlot  I could live a life like [her servant] Puah's  with little joy over the generations But I could not worship the gods that were an abomination to my father  I could not betray Avihail  whose living seed remained in none other than me  I could not crush the memory of his righteous ways I had hoped to fulfill my days in Mordechai's household and to give him strong sons  Mordechai was a stranger to his people's ways  but my father would have lived on through the generations of our children's children  For Mordechai was still a Jew in his heart  He would walk among the idolaters  but he would not worship a stranger's gods And I could not do so now This doubleness is  of course  the key to the story  indeed to much of Jewish history  The struggle of a stateless Jewish people to conform sufficiently on the outside to fit into hostile societies but to maintain their faith and their traditions internally has played out for thousands of years  often with tragic results  As we look back at the story of Mordechai and Esther through the tragic lens of the Holocaust we can see how dangerous the tale is with its suggestion that if only the Jewish people are sufficiently righteous before G-d and pleasing in the eyes of their temporal rulers they will be spared  or at least empowered to protect themselves  Here are the most fateful Bible verses [E]sther spake unto Hatach  and gave him commandment unto Mor'decai;All the king's servants  and the people of the king's provinces  do know  that whosoever  whether man or woman  shall come unto the king into the inner court  who is not called  there is one law of his to put him to death  except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre  that he may live  but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days And they told to Mor'decai Esther's words Then Mor'decai commanded to answer Esther  Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house  more than allthe Jews For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time  then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed  and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?It's almost unbearably harsh to contemplate  but perhaps the lesson of the Holocaust is that the charge Mordechai places upon Esther applies to every Jew  to speak and act against injustice directed at their people lest they fall prey to it themselves At any rate  if the fictionalized portions of the book flesh out the characters it is when the biblical events return that the novel achieves great drama  The contest between Haman and Mordechai  with Esther ultimately determining the outcome  is thrilling even in the Bible's bare bones version  but all the more so once Ms Kohn has personalized it for us  At a time when every women's book club in America is fretting about its next choice and the box office and best-seller charts are topped by religion-themed works  the novel should find a wide audience and it richly deserves one the Jews For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time  then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed  and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<BR>It's almost unbearably harsh to contemplate  but perhaps the lesson of the Holocaust is that the charge Mordechai places upon Esther applies to every Jew  to speak and act against injustice directed at their people lest they fall prey to it themselves At any rate  if the fictionalized portions of the book flesh out the characters it is when the biblical events return that the novel achieves great drama  The contest between Haman and Mordechai  with Esther ultimately determining the outcome  is thrilling even in the Bible's bare bones version  but all the more so once Ms Kohn has personalized it for us  At a time when every women's book club in America is fretting about its next choice and the box office and best-seller charts are topped by religion-themed works  the novel should find a wide audience and it richly deserves one 
Author Info William Dietrich09/29/1951-Two centuries after it was built by the Emperor Hadrian  a Roman couple has come to Britannia to take charge of the Wall  which keeps the barbarian Celts out of Roman Britain  Young Valeria is the daughter of a senator  as dowry she's brought this command to Marcus Flavius  who badly needs some military experience to advance his career  But plumping down the beautiful Valeria and the Marcus in the wilds of Rome's frontier provokes jealousy and passions that lead to war  In particular  the brutal and ambitious soldier Galba Brassidias and the Celtic chief Arden Caratacus are both drawn to Valeria and despise her husband If some of the characterizations seem kind of idiosyncratic and ahistorical--their actions  emotions  and openness are awfully modern--there's nonetheless ample enough action and romance to speed us past any tendency to overanalyze it as a work of history  There's also a fascinating tripartite culture clash  with the conflict between the somewhat rigid social conventions of Rome and the wilder  freer life of the Celts and then percolating beneath both the burgeoning influence of the new religion  Christianity  which will plow them both under eventually  It's all framed by the device of an investigation into events that have already transpired  which allows for some discursive passages on the background of the tale but does fracture the narrative at times  You may find yourself wondering why Mr  Dietrich doesn't just get back to the main story As historical romances go it's not up to the standards of a Sharon Kay Penman  but it's an ideal beach book  one that you can hand to the spouse when you're done with reasonable confidence they'll enjoy it 
Plenty of folks can tell you where they were when JFK was shot or the Challenger exploded or what have you--Red Sox and Yankee fans can tell you where they were when Grady Little sent Pedro out to pitch the 8th  or when Dave Righetti pitched a 4th of July no-hitter  or when Bucky &quot;F'in&quot; Dent hit The Homerun   For all those fans we highly recommend this new book by Harvey Frommer  a long-time chronicler of the Yankees  and his son  Frederic They've combined a history of the two teams and their many contests with personal reminiscences--their own and those of players  other fans  and the rich and famous--and a host of terrific photographs to create a kind of scrapbook of the rivalry that some refer to as the American version of Athens (Boston) vs  Sparta (New York)  In a book awash with great anecdotes it's hard to pick just one  but here's a Don Zimmer quote from the period when the tension between the two great catchers  Carlton Fisk and Thurman Munson  was as fierce as that between the teams in general Fisk hated Munson  Munson hated Fisk  and everyone hated Bill Lee Such hatreds have never been more enjoyable than they are in these pages 
Rick Atkinson's Army at Dawn--for which he was awarded a Pulitzer  while embedded in Iraq--is a terrific first volume in a projected trilogy on the American infantry in WWII and he's already written one of the better volumes on the initial Iraq War in 1991  Crusade  So  it's easy to see why he'd have jumped at the chance to cover the desert warfare of the second Iraq War up close and personal Many will already be familiar with the dispatches he filed for the Washington Post during the conflict and he brings the immediacy of such reportage to this memoir of being embedded with the 101st Airborne  but that's both a strength and its weakness  It's a strength in so far as he provides us a gifted reporter's ground-eye-view of the challenges and confusions soldiers and commanders face in the midst of combat and in the build-up to and aftermath of war  But it's a weakness in that the intentional lack of perspective makes people--not least himself--seem silly and petulant at times  For instance  the most controversial story he contributed to while in theater was War Could Last Months  Officers Say (Thomas E  Ricks  March 27  2003  Washington Post) Despite the rapid advance of Army and Marine forces across Iraq over the past week  some senior U S  military officers are now convinced that the war is likely to last months and will require considerably more combat power than is now on hand there and in Kuwait  senior defense officials said yesterday The combination of wretched weather  long and insecure supply lines  and an enemy that has refused to be supine in the face of American military might has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of U S  military expectations and timelines  Some of them see even the potential threat of a drawn-out fight that sucks in more and more U S  forces  Both on the battlefield in Iraq and in Pentagon conference rooms  military commanders were talking yesterday about a longer  harder war than had been expected just a week ago  the officials said &quot;Tell me how this ends &quot; one senior officer said yesterday Read with the knowledge that the regime fell 21 days after the start of the war this can't help but seem even more hysterical now than it did then  Moreover  it seems likely that the Post and its correspondents  including Mr  Atkinson  were being used by the uniformed military  which wanted more troops  in bureaucratic infighting against the Pentagon's political leadership--Secretaries Rumsfeld  Wolfowitz and the like  In that case the story wasn't just absurd  as becomes obvious in retrospect  but an instance of the press allowing itself to be manipulated  willingly or not  At any rate  it's singularly unedifying and such despair is not uncommon in the book  One wonders how much easier the victory could have been but perhaps the answer is that for the men fighting them all wars just suck and every day is a quagmire  If so  that's a valuable enough lesson to learn  especially for those of us who get to sit home and send others out to fight  but it does suggest that we shouldn't take their complaints terribly seriously Somewhat allied to this problem of quagmirism is Mr  Atkinson's obvious opposition to the war  He has every right to disapprove of it  but he makes a couple of disturbing comments along the way  At one point he makes fun of two soldiers for arguing that it was not a war about oil  As events have shown  and as all but true partisans surely recognized at the time  they were right and he wrong  Another  even more galling  instance of his cynicism comes when the great journalist and fellow embed Michael Kelly is killed in an accident and Mr  Atkinson refers to it as &quot;senseless &quot; Now  perhaps he just means the accidental nature of the tragedy is senseless  but the death of a reporter in the very act of reporting on a dangerous situation seems the very opposite of senseless  It is noble On the plus side  and the plus side is considerable  Mr  Atkinson centers the book around the compelling figure of Major General David Petraeus  who he also &gt;profiled extensively for the Post  The General exemplifies the intelligence  political sensitivity  hypercompetitiveness  and ambition of the modern officer corps  The portrayal of General Petraeus and of other senior officers in the 101st  like Lt  Gen  William Wallace  are excellent and give us much cause for pride in our armed forces  Also interesting are Mr  Atkinson's reports on events he was able to experience in real time--or at least their aftermaths--like the grenade and shooting attack by an American G I who'd converted to Islam that took place just before the war kicked off while the 101st was stationed in Kuwait  And  as mentioned above  Mr  Atkinson's own confusion about the events going on around him--as well as that of the officers he was talking to--reminds us of the wisdom of Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace  that the belief that commanders are in control of events is an illusion  War is by its nature a chaotic enterprise where what you think you know at any given moment is more than likely wrong Of course the story ends before we know how things will turn out in Iraq  By the end of Mr  Atkinson's stay it had already become obvious that diehards and extremists were going to cause significant problems as they resisted American  allied  and Iraqi efforts to reform the nation  But the pessimism with which the book concludes will hopefully turn out to be just one more case of being lost in the fog of war  When Mr  Atkinson sits down to write a history of the second Iraq War a few years from now it will be interesting to see how the perspective afforded by temporal distance changes the judgments he made here  while he was in the thick of things siderable  Mr  Atkinson centers the book around the compelling figure of Major General David Petraeus  who he also &gt;profiled extensively for the Post  The General exemplifies the intelligence  political sensitivity  hypercompetitiveness  and ambition of the modern officer corps  The portrayal of General Petraeus and of other senior officers in the 101st  like Lt  Gen  William Wallace  are excellent and give us much cause for pride in our armed forces  Also interesting are Mr  Atkinson's reports on events he was able to experience in real time--or at least their aftermaths--like the grenade and shooting attack by an American G I who'd converted to Islam that took place just before the war kicked off while the 101st was stationed in Kuwait  And  as mentioned above  Mr  Atkinson's own confusion about the events going on around him--as well as that of the officers he was talking to--reminds us of the wisdom of Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace  that the belief that commanders are in control of events is an illusion  War is by its nature a chaotic enterprise where what you think you know at any given moment is more than likely wrong  Of course the story ends before we know how things will turn out in Iraq  By the end of Mr  Atkinson's stay it had already become obvious that diehards and extremists were going to cause significant problems as they resisted American  allied  and Iraqi efforts to reform the nation  But the pessimism with which the book concludes will hopefully turn out to be just one more case of being lost in the fog of war  When Mr  Atkinson sits down to write a history of the second Iraq War a few years from now it will be interesting to see how the perspective afforded by temporal distance changes the judgments he made here  while he was in the thick of things

The central conceit of recent films like True Lies and Spy Kids has been seeming mundane husbands  wives  and  parents who turn out to be top secret agents  John Maxim goes them one better and imagines that much of  Westport  Connecticut is peopled by semi-retired agents  loosely led by Paul Bannerman  who have all gotten out of  the game (almost) and are trying to settle down to stable marriages  child-rearing  running small shops  and an  especially adept neighborhood watch program   In this entry in the successful series  Bannerman has to set his travel agency business to one side just long enough to  deal with Artemus Bourne  a megalomaniacal villain (is there any other kind) who's threatening Westport with a  bioterror attack because he wants help finding famed assassin Elizabeth Stride  the Black Angel  a former colleague of Bannerman  whose  supposedly-dead ex-boyfriend  an East German named Martin Kessler  has interfered in his African diamond and arms smuggling business  The  interference in this case takes the form of sending Bourne the heads of three evil minions  Bannerman's   "Ghosts  "  so called because they've  disappeared from the world of black-ops  are galvanized into reasonably exciting action amidst presumably tongue-in-cheek worries about their  domestic situations  Mr  Maxim utilizes just enough realistic background setting--like the genuine threat of Marburg virus--to give the story  weight  but a light enough touch to keep it amusing  rather than melodramatic   Fans will be gratified that he brings together characters from a host of his prior books  while newcomers will have no trouble catching up  It's brisk  entartainment with just a hint of satire  or so one assumes      Grade  (B)
When Waugh wrote this trilogy  between 1951 and 1964  people loved the acerbity of his writing  But  they found Crouchback and his views perverse  In those days  the thought that the Second World War might  have been an error which left the world worse than it found it was almost unthinkable   There had been frightful blunders such as Singapore  admitted the reader in the National Health spectacles   But to see it all as a mistake  you would have to be   well  either a fascist or a believer in something perfectly  weird  For instance  a devout member of the old English Roman Catholic aristocracy  Down the narrow  perspective of that particular telescope  through which the welfare of the Vatican mattered more than cutting  Axis communications in the Balkans  things might well look different   They did to fictional Guy Crouchback   -The Crouchback tendency (Neal Ascherson  January 7  2001  The Observer)  Like many of Evelyn Waugh's books  this one--the first in the Sword of Honour trilogy--is at least semi-autobiographical  But  whereas other  life experiences gave him the fodder to savagely satirize such things as adultery/divorce  journalism  Africa  and Hollywood  his treatment of his  checkered military career  probably tempered by a natural patriotism  comes in more for gentle ribbing  So there are plenty of amusing characters  and absurd situations  beginning with the nature of the enlistee  Guy Crouchback  himself   'We don't want cannon-fodder this time'--from the Services--'we learned our lesson in 1914 when we threw away the pick of the  nation  That's what we've suffered from ever since   'But I'm not the pick of the nation ' said Guy  'I'm natural fodder  I've no dependants  I've no special skill in anything  What's more I'm  getting old  I'm ready for immediate consumption  You should take the 35s now and give the young men time to get sons '  'I'm afraid that's not the official view  I'll put you on our list and see you're notified as soon as anything turns up '  But Mr  Waugh's heart  understandably  doesn't seem to be invested in really letting loose on the British armed services  This combines with the  subject of the story--the painfully slow build-up to war--to render a novel that's somewhat less spirited than many of his others   However  it does have one feature that more than redeems it and makes it not only one of his most invaluable works  but one of the most important  novels of WWII  its ferocious criticism of the British decision to accept the Soviet Union as an ally  rather than treat her as an enemy just as  dangerous as Nazi Germany  Guy's initial fervor for war comes as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact   Just seven days earlier he had opened his morning newspaper on the headlines announcing the Russian-German alliance  News that  shook the politicians and young poets of a dozen capital cities brought deep peace to one English heart  [   ] He lived too close to Fascism  in Italy to share the opposing enthusiasms of his countrymen  He saw it neither as a calamity nor as a rebirth; as a rough improvisation  merely  He disliked the men who were edging themselves into power around him  but English denunciations sounded fatuous and  dishonest and for the past three years he had given up his English newspapers  The German Nazis he knew to be mad and bad  Their  participation dishonoured the cause of Spain  but the troubles of Bohemia  the year before  left him quite indifferent  When Prague fell   he knew that war was inevitable  He expected his country to go to war in a panic  for the wrong reasons or for no reason at all  with the  wrong allies  in pitiful weakness  But now  splendidly  everything had become clear  The enemy at last was plain in view  huge and  hateful  all disguise cast off  It was the Modern Age in arms  Whatever the outcome there was a place for him in that battle   But he despairs when  Hitler having betrayed Stalin  the Soviets are thereupon blithely accepted as comrades   Russia invaded Poland  Guy found no sympathy among these old soldiers for his own hot indignation   'My dear fellow  we've quite enough on our hands as it is  We can't go to war with the whole world '  'Then why go to war at all?

We are here to abet creation and to witness it  to notice each thing  so each thing gets noticed      so that Creation need not play to an empty  house   -Annie Dillard  The key scene in M  Night Shyamalan's film Signs comes when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) are discussing the  implications of what seems to be an alien visitation  signaled by a number of lights that have appeared over Mexico City   People --- break down into two groups  When they experience something lucky  group number one sees it as more than luck or a  coincidence  They see it as a sign  evidence that there is Someone out there watching out for them  Group number two sees it as just pure luck  a  happy turn of chance  Well sure there are people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way  For them  the  situation isn't fifty/ fifty could be bad  could be good   but deep down they feel that whatever happens  they are on their own  and that fills them  with fear   Yeah  there are those people  but there's a whole lot of people in group number one  When they see those fourteen lights they are looking at a  miracle  And deep down they feel that whatever is going to happen  there will be Someone there to help them  and that fills them with hope   So what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs  sees miracles  or do you believe that people  just get lucky? Or look at the question this way --- is it possible that there are no coincidences?  Luci Shaw's poetry is based on the thrill of finding those signs in the everyday  of having faith that it is God who has placed them there and hope because of that   A few examples will serve to give the flavor of the batch and speak far more eloquently than can I   We know this to start with   If we understood everything we wouldn't  be baffled  But mystery lives; somehow  without witchcraft or chicanery  we collect sounds and colors in a skyward  dish  like fruit in a bowl  and channel them  into verisimilitude--faces talking at us  from the tube's glass eye  Hallways of fog  enfold us in enigma  And then  the marvel of  window glass--how can anything be  hard enough to stop the hand and  hold its smudge while letting through this  soft light? The one wheat kernel that  breeds a thousand--a miracle of  loaves over and over again   The stars  invisible in the blind day  revealed  thick as pollen  by the absence  of light  A billion spiky grass blades that melt  into a perfectly flat horizon  The Holy Ghost  waking me in my bedroom  drenching my  dry heart with fluid syllables  breathing  flesh into the fetal bones of this poem   Rising  The underground tree  (Cornus sanguinea and cornus canadensis)  One spring in Tennessee I walked a tunnel  under dogwood trees  noting the petals  (in fours like crosses) and at each tender apex  four russet stains dark at Christ-wounds   I knew that with the year the dogwood flower heads  would ripen into berry clusters bright as drops of gore   Last week  a double-click on Botany  startled me with the kinship of those trees and bunch-berries  whose densely crowded mat  carpets the deep woods around my valley cabin   Only their flowers--those white quartets of petals--  suggest the blood relationship  Since then I see  the miniature leaves and buds as tips of trees  burgeoning underground  knotted roots like limbs  pushing up to light through rock and humus   The pure cross-flowers at my feet redeem  their long  dark burial in the ground  show how even  a weight of stony soil cannot keep Easter at bay   Bubble  I watch it being blown swelling and rising  from my grandson's red plastic ring  fresh-filled  with eager air  tenuous as just-spilled  dandelion silk  a fluid wobble  quite surprising  me with its likeness to our cosmic bubble   all greens and blues  each continent and sea  etched in bright enamel by God and gravity--  a film's fine iridescence fixed  The trouble  is  before the shivering  frail balloon has hovered  long it bursts in a star of spray that pricks my skin  with cool fireworks  so that  in vanishing  it winks  at my comparison just as the simile is offered   But mind's a watercolor paper  This visual spasm  has brushed me with its indelible  swift  rainbow strokes of form and gleam  My visions shift  between the micro- and the macrocosm   ephemeral both  as radiant as grace   glass globules in the furnace air  both sealed  off after a creative breath  and then annealed   floating their minor vessels into space   Reading these poems awakens us to the wonder of the world around us and  if we've a mind to allow it  transforms the mundane into the miraculous  You can't help but observe your surroundings  more closely and ponder existence more fiercely  And it's certainly possible that you'll choose to be the kind of person who views it all as lucky chance and insists we're alone and nothing means  anything  But  there's also a possibility that you too will see signs and miracles and be infused with hope  Ms

After sober reflection  I state my conviction that  if I lived the length of a dozen lives  I should never again be the spectator of such an amazing   thrilling and magnificent finish to an Open championship   -Bernard Darwin (1876-1961)  The Times of London  Mark Frost has already proven himself a terrific writer  with such television series as the great Hill Street Blues and the innovative Twin Peaks to his credit   and a few successful novels  including the excellent Sherlock Holmes homage  The List of Seven&gt;  and a sequel  The Six Messiahs  But I don't know that  anything can have prepared even his fans for this book  which  though one must have some reservations about its form  is quite simply one of the best golf  books ever written   To begin with  Mr  Frost has chosen his topic wisely  Harry Vardon (1870-1937) and Francis Ouimet (1893-1967)--both of whom came from working  class families  had difficult relationships with their fathers  and learned to golf as boys at the local courses where they caddied  Ouimet in Massachusetts  Vardon some twenty-plus years earlier on  the Isle of Jersey--are thoroughly compelling heroes  In 1913 their similar stories converged at The Country Club  in Brookline  MA--the very club at which Francis had caddied--in the United  States Open  Harry Vardon was at that time probably the best golfer in the world and in previous visits to America had been instrumental in marketing the game here  But it was to be the young  amateur Francis Ouimet's playoff victory over the professional Vardon and countryman Ted Ray that  or so Mr  Frost argues  gave birth to the modern golf era in America   The book starts with extended biographical sketches of the two men and the events that brought them to the tee for their face-off  Numerous other characters are on hand to lend color--two of  whom stand out  and will be the star-making roles in the inevitable movie  the dashing young American professional Walter Hagen (golf's eventual answer to Babe Ruth) and Eddie Lowery   Ouimet's preternaturally self-assured ten year old caddie  Digressions inform us about changes in rules and equipment  the professionalization of the sport  and its popularization  But it is the  tournament itself that forms the bulk of the book  particularly the final day  the Monday playoff  when the little known twenty year old  playing before large and enthusiastic hometown galleries  on a  course across the street from his own house  had to fend off two of the world's best   Mr  Frost's prose gets a tad purplish at times  but personally I thought that gave it the feel  of old time sportswriting  Besides  the story is so improbable that the reality seems like a clich?  so why not  write it like a sports movie? More troubling is that Mr  Frost has chosen to provide dialogue and to ascribe thoughts and feelings to the various players even though he has had to create some of it  himself  without ever differentiating which is which  Although it serves his purposes as a storyteller well  fleshing out the characters and letting us see them interact &quot;naturally&quot; with one another  it  actually becomes distracting because you can't help but wondering which thoughts and words come from people's memoirs and contemporaneous accounts of the event (which are apparently  sufficiently extensive so that much of what's here is genuine) and which are purely made up  It also--though we've seen experiments of this kind in recent years  like Edmund Morris's  Dutch--seems more than a little unfair to attribute imagined words and emotions to real people who don't have an opportunity to dispute or confirm them  It would  I think  have been preferable to  simply call the book a novelization  in the tradition of Michael Sharaa's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Gettysburg  The Killer Angels  At the very least  there should be footnotes to indicate where  truth ends and fiction begins  From an author or publisher's point of view there may be reasons not to do these things--just in terms of the sales and marketing of novels vs  nonfiction and reader  dislike of footnotes--but from a standpoint of intellectual rigor it's somewhat disconcerting   Once you get past these considerations--and take my word for it  the writing and the story are so exciting that you will get past any questions--you're in for an unbelievably thrilling tale  It's  especially recommended for golf fans  who will find the tangential stuff about the clubs and balls they used just as interesting as the championship  but it should really appeal to everyone  in much the  same way that Seabiscuit reached past horse race fans to a wide audience  It's a marvelous read and seems certain to make for a great movie   Grade  (A+)l Sharaa's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Gettysburg  The Killer Angels  At the very least  there should be footnotes to indicate where<BR>       truth ends and fiction begins  From an author or publisher's point of view there may be reasons not to do these things--just in terms of the sales and marketing of novels vs  nonfiction and reader<BR>       dislike of footnotes--but from a standpoint of intellectual rigor it's somewhat disconcerting         Once you get past these considerations--and take my word for it  the writing and the story are so exciting that you will get past any questions--you're in for an unbelievably thrilling tale  It's<BR>       especially recommended for golf fans  who will find the tangential stuff about the clubs and balls they used just as interesting as the championship  but it should really appeal to everyone  in much the<BR>       same way that Seabiscuit reached past horse race fans to a wide audience  It's a marvelous read and seems certain to make for a great movie         Grade  (A+)
First  a confession  I feel somewhat like a husband whose been disloyal  if only in his heart  to a faithful and altogether wonderful wife  just because he's  grown bored by the very routine of their relationship  I've been reading John McPhee since I was a kid and he was writing about Princeton and  Knickerbocker hero Bill Bradley  In those nearly forty years I can't recall a single uninteresting piece he's written and many of them are marvelous  But  when this book came over the transom was my reaction  great  a new John McPhee!? No  To my shame  it was  oh geez  350 more routinely excellent pages  from McPhee  Are there so many good authors out there that one can afford to be blas&eacute; about one of the best? Would I rather a book that might quite possibly  stink  written by someone else  just for the uncertainty involved in reading it? How callow   In my own defense though  this time out Mr  McPhee is writing about the American shad  I'm as big a fan of fishing literature as anyone  but who does not  feel  when they see a new fishing book nowadays  the way C S  Lewis felt one night at a meeting of the Inklings  when J R R  Tolkien prepared to read to the  assembled from his latest work    "Oh  no! Not another [freaking] elf!  "? In your heart of hearts  don't you say to yourself    "Oh  no! Not another freaking fishing book!  "?  All the more reason to feel like a fool now  having read the book  when Mr  McPhee has demonstrated once again that he's one of the finest non-fiction writers in our history and that there's still plenty  of life in the fishing genre  Mr  McPhee may not quite have invented the technique of taking a topic and looking at it in detail from top to bottom--the shelves are packed with books that have  borrowed the technique  books with names like  Salt; Cod; Tobacco; and Coal--but he is the master  And so  in this book  we get the entire natural history of the fish and no one will finish the last page  wishing he knew more about the shad  However  there are two segments that stand out and definitively lift the work out of the ordinary  It opens with that most hackneyed of scenes  an epic battle to  land the big one  but in the author's capable hands it somehow seems new and fresh  It goes on for page after page  until the cops have even shown up--at his wife's request  to make sure he's not  dead--until the climax can't possibly be worthy of the fight  but still he manages to make it satisfying   The other highlight surprises because it's so politically incorrect  The final chapter takes on not only PETA and other animal rights groups but well-intentioned fishermen everywhere to challenge the  notion of catch and release  Honestly and guiltlessly discussing the inevitable damage that just landing a fish does to the animal  he leaves little doubt that however good releasing them may make  fishermen and activists feel about themselves  it does little to help fish or fisheries   This ability to make the old seem fresh and to look at the seemingly sacred from a fresh perspective  make Mr  McPhee  even in his twenty-sixth book  a writer of currency and pertinence  I repent of  my sin and I shan't ever doubt him again of the fish and no one will finish the last page<BR>       wishing he knew more about the shad  However  there are two segments that stand out and definitively lift the work out of the ordinary  It opens with that most hackneyed of scenes  an epic battle to<BR>       land the big one  but in the author's capable hands it somehow seems new and fresh  It goes on for page after page  until the cops have even shown up--at his wife's request  to make sure he's not<BR>       dead--until the climax can't possibly be worthy of the fight  but still he manages to make it satisfying         The other highlight surprises because it's so politically incorrect  The final chapter takes on not only PETA and other animal rights groups but well-intentioned fishermen everywhere to challenge the<BR>       notion of catch and release  Honestly and guiltlessly discussing the inevitable damage that just landing a fish does to the animal  he leaves little doubt that however good releasing them may make<BR>       fishermen and activists feel about themselves  it does little to help fish or fisheries        This ability to make the old seem fresh and to look at the seemingly sacred from a fresh perspective  make Mr  McPhee  even in his twenty-sixth book  a writer of currency and pertinence  I repent of<BR>       my sin and I shan't ever doubt him again 
Finley Peter Dunne was famed both for his sportswriting  covering the Chicago White Sox  and for his humorous columns featuring the imaginary  saloonkeeper  Mr  Dooley  who would spout his   "wisdom  " in a broken Irish brogue  Dunne had been writing these essays for nearly a decade when the  Spanish-American War came and his (and Mr  Dooley's) criticism of it  as an imperialist enterprise  won him a national readership  plaudits from  intellectuals  and friendship with folks like Mark Twain and  improbably  with arch-imperialist Teddy Roosevelt   The essays rely heavily on wringing humor from dialect  something that got laughs more reliably in that era of minstrel shows and the like  What's most  interesting today about their politics is that they're of a piece with Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Orwell's Shooting an Elephant  in that they're  anti-imperialist because of the effect it will have on the colonizers  rather than the colonized  Here's a representative sample   **Wan iv the worst things about this here war is th' way it's makin' puzzles f'r our poor  tired heads  Whin I wint into it  I thought all I'd have to  do was to set up here behind th' bar with a good tin-cint see-gar in me teeth  an' toss dinnymite bombs into th' hated city iv Havana  But look  at me now  Th' war is still goin' on; an' ivry night  whin I'm countin' up the cash  I'm askin' mesilf will I annex Cubia or lave it to the Cubians?

David Lodge is justly revered as both one of the best comic novelists of recent decades and as a writer who explores serious moral themes through his satire   Folks then were somewhat disappointed when this novella was published  because it's not quite up to the standards of his novels  Perhaps they're being a tad  fanatical   As Mr  Lodge acknowledges up front  Home Truths began life as a play and for purposes of this novelization he did not make major alterations  This leaves it  with all the unnaturalness of theater--a single setting  just four characters  and a reliance on dialogue--despite the new format  You can either accept the  limitations this imposes and be grateful for a chance to read an awkward but worthwhile piece that wasn't coming to a theater near you anytime soon  or you  can dwell on the matter and not enjoy the book   Adrian Ludlow is a somewhat accomplished but now mostly silent author who's   "retired  " to an isolated English cottage with his wife  Eleanor  Over  breakfast one morning they agonize over  and thrill to  a newspaper interview their old friend  screenwriter Sam Sharp  gave to an up and coming journalist  Fanny Tarrant  who's made her reputation  by eviscerating the self-absorbed celebrity subjects of her profiles  A representative sample from the story on Sam reads   The first thing you notice about Samuel Sharp's study is that it's plastered with trophies  certificates and citations for prizes and awards  and framed press photographs of Samuel Sharp   like the interior of an Italian restaurant  The second thing you notice is the full-length mirror on one wall    "It's to give the room a feeling of space   " the writer explained  but you can't help  thinking there's another reason  His eyes keep sliding sideways  drawn irresistibly by this mirror even while he's speaking to you  I went to see Samuel Sharp wondering why he had  been so unlucky in matrimony  I left thinking I knew the answer  the man's insufferable vanity   It gets worse  But the truth is even these old friends are enjoying seeing him get his comeuppance  because he is just as vain as he's made out to be in the article   However  Sam soon arrives at the cottage and enlists Adrian's help in a scheme to get back at Ms Tarrant  Adrian will submit to an interview too  but even as he's being profiled he'll secretly profile  her and sell the resulting hatchet job to a rival paper  The middle portion of the book--Act II  if you will--consists of the counter interviews  Ms Tarrant turns out to be not only quite attractive and a  decent enough sort but also an unabashed fan of Adrian's best known novel  Adrian remains guarded as he digs into her life and eventually convinces her to try his sauna  Eleanor  who'd not wished to  be a party to the charade  arrives home at a guilty-looking moment and  when Adrian is out of the room  simply unloads on him to the eager journalist  In particular  she's devastating in regards to the  difficulty that his inability to duplicate the success of that early novel had on their home lives  She tells a number of painful pent up truths  but tells them to someone who may now share them with the  whole world   In the final act  Sam and Eleanor and Adrian   who's stopped speaking to his wife entirely  anxiously await the arrival of the paper that will have the dreaded profile  But as they wait Ms Tarrant shows  up unexpectedly  Unbeknownst to the cottagers it's just been announced that Diana was killed in a car accident while trying to escape the paparazzi  so no one's likely to read or remember a profile of  forgotten novelist Adrian Ludlow  Unfortunately though  Ms Tarrant just happens to have a second piece in that morning's paper  one that's particularly harsh towards the suddenly martyred Princess   Mr  Lodge brings forward a series of interesting points here  There'sthe strange nature of our celebrity culture  which sees oceans of ink and film devoted to people who are rarely worth knowing  about and who  more often than not  have done nothing of real value  As Fanny Tarrant says   I perform a valuable cultural function  [   ]  There's such a lot of hype nowadays  people confuse success with real achievement  I remind them of the difference   But there's also a strange symbiosis between the celebrity and the journalist such that there's truly no such thing as bad publicity and the supposed exposer of the ugly truths about the rich and famous  ends up being just another celebrant  And what surprises all of them  people who should be wise to the rules of the game if anyone should  is how much they are affected by news of Di's death   As the sound of the TV news coverage became audible  Adrian sat down on the chaise lounge to watch with the other two [Eleanor and Sam]    "I don't know   " he said    "A death can  make a difference  Even the death of someone you never knew  if it's sufficiently     "    "Poetic?

I'd put off reading this one because it's got a reputation as a great anti-war novel (sort of the anti-Starship Troopers)  particularly anti-Vietnam (where Mr  Haldeman served)  and I'm neither   But regardless of Mr  Haldeman's intent  it reads today as one of the most conservative books in the history of science fiction The plot is pretty simple  in Earth's near future  an army of super-soldiers is drafted by the U N  to go and fight the Taurans  a mysterious alien species which has apparently been attacking human space ships that have just made collapsar jumps (at  999 the speed of light) and arrived near Aldebaran   The narrator is William Mandella who will fight the Taurans for a millennium  because of the disparity in how much time passes for him relative to Earth during his travels   This means though that ever time he and his fellow soldiers return home  massive social changes have taken place   So he returns to population explosions  euthanasia  and government controlled economies; then to a future where homosexuality and test tube babies have become the norm (and population stabilized at a billion people); and finally to a world where humankind has become nothing but a population of identical clones sharing a mind   On this final return home  Mandella finds that the Forever War has all been a result of misunderstanding and a plot by militarist   The 1143-year-long war had begun on false pretenses and only continued because the two races were unable to communicate   Once they could talk  the first question was   "Why did you start this thing?  " and the answer was   "Me?  "  The Taurans hadn't known war for millennia  and toward the beginning of the twenty-first century it looked as though mankind was ready  to outgrow the institution as well   But the old soldiers were still around  and many of them in positions of power   They virtually ran  the United Nations Exploratory and Colonization Group  that was taking advantage of the newly-discovered collapsar jump to explore  interstellar space   Many of the early ships met with accidents and disappeared   The ex-military men were suspicious   They armed the colonizing vessels   and the first time they met a Tauran ship  they blasted it   They dusted off their medals and the rest was going to be history   You couldn't blame it all on the military  though   The evidence they presented for the Taurans having been responsible for the earlier  casualties was laughably thin   The few people who pointed this out were ignored   The fact was  Earth's economy needed a war  and this one was ideal   It was a nice hole to throw buckets of money into  but would unify  humanity rather than dividing it This entirely risible concoction of Mr  Haldeman's appears to be about equal parts Dr  Strangelove and Report from Iron Mountain  just as his population worries reflect the most hysterical ravings of Paul Ehrlich and his celebration of drugs is leftover Timothy Leary   In short  he fell prey to nearly every quackery of the 70s   And if the Forever War is really supposed to be an allegory for the Vietnam War  the notion that Vietnam was about nothing surely went out of fashion with the boat people   The judgments of history have been unkind to Mr  Haldeman's overt politics Oddly though  there's an unintentional covert politics at work here that succeeds brilliantly and remains trenchant and true   For one thing  the book offers a convincing argument against gays in the military and is downright homophobic   But as an overarching matter  it seems obvious that the world that Mandella and his fellow soldiers once knew is much preferable to the Earth they keep returning to  with its big government  declining morality   cheapening of human life  and finally the disappearance of the individual   The closing pages are as good an argument against bio-engineering/cloning as you'll find anywhere on the ChristianConservative Right today Unfortunately for Mr  Haldeman  while the future he predicted as a result of militarism turned out to be a delusion  the world that peace and plenty may bring turns out to resemble his nightmare   When  at the end of the novel  Mandella and his woman reject the new Earth and settle instead on Middle Finger  they turn out to be flipping the bird to precisely the kind of placid but pointless  grotesquely egalitarian  utopia that the Left dreams of today   The folks who were   "stuck  " in the military  with it's unchanging values  turn out to be the great hope of the species   I must confess  I take great joy in this perverse reversal that events have wrought on Mr  Haldeman's book GRADE  A- (though accidentally)find anywhere on the Christian Conservative Right today  Unfortunately for Mr  Haldeman  while the future he predicted as a result of militarism turned out to be a delusion  the world that peace and plenty may bring turns out to resemble his nightmare   When  at the end of the novel  Mandella and his woman reject the new Earth and settle instead on Middle Finger  they turn out to be flipping the bird to precisely the kind of placid but pointless  grotesquely egalitarian  utopia that the Left dreams of today   The folks who were   "stuck  " in the military  with it's unchanging values  turn out to be the great hope of the species   I must confess  I take great joy in this perverse reversal that events have wrought on Mr  Haldeman's book  GRADE  A- (though accidentally)
The sea was so vast  and the ship was so small   Man and everything made by man is finite   -Richard Winning  owner of the Winston Churchill  reciting a seafarers' prayer at a Memorial ServiceAt the outset  let me just say that the Brothers Judd full disclosure policy requires me to acknowledge that Mr  Knecht is a fraternity brother of mine and if the book stunk  I'd not say so   In fact  the first few pages had me a little worried because there's some rather pedestrian prose and one of the yachts in the race was owned and skippered by Larry Ellison  of Oracle  who seems early on like he's going to be the center of attention in the book   This would be unfortunate because he's a difficult man to root for  at least as presented here  often in his own words   Actually  most of the yachtsmen seem fairly unlikable   It sometimes seems like every one of them thinks he's the only competent guy on board   But any initial concerns disappear once the storm hits and as the action at sea picks up so too does Mr  Knecht's writing The Sydney to Hobart race is apparently quite a big deal in Australia; from the sound of it  nearly the whole nation stops to watch the start on Boxing Day (December 26th)   In 1998  115 unsuspecting boats set out but only 43 made it to Hobart (Tasmania)   Seven boats were abandoned and another five actually sank   55 men were rescued   Six men died   The race had run into hurricane conditions  a cyclone sporting 80 mile per hour winds  and the sleek  ultra-engineered boats seem to have been particularly unsuited to such weather   In short order men were in the water and it is mostly them that Mr  Knecht follows and it is there that the book becomes genuinely thrilling  and terrifying The crew of the Winston Churchill  which was capsized by a 60 foot wall of water that broke over it  ended up in two life rafts   The other crew whose ordeal Mr  Knecht chronicles had been aboard the Sword of Orion   The hours  even days  these men spent in the water make for painful reading   One of the indelible images from the book is that of survivors recalling the sight of the bobbing heads of crewmates just a hundred yards away and knowing there's no way to get to them   The stories of these men and  as in The Perfect Storm  of the rescuers  make for a substantial portion of the book and it's outstanding A shorter concluding portion  featuring various courtroom hearings  unfortunately serves to remind us that  with some exceptions  these sailors just aren't a terribly sympathetic lot   Mr  Knecht presumably chose to write about Larry Ellison because he's a well known figure and a major businessman (Mr  Knecht writes for the Wall Street Journal)  but he becomes kind of emblematic of the hubris that plagues them all    I could have bought the New York Yankees  but I couldn't be the team's shortstop   With the boat  I actually get to play on the team Note he's characterizing himself not just as any old player but as the shortstop   Likewise  Lachlan Murdoch  son of Rupert  who sailed on Ellison's boat  Sayanora  has this to say    There are people who in their makeup need to take risks   [   ]  Every once in a while I just have to do things that require me to make  judgments about how far I can go It takes a nearly superhuman effort on the part of the reader not to wish that it had been their boat that foundered   In this regard the book has a significant structural weakness in common with The Perfect Storm in that we spend too much time with people we don't care about and not enough time with some of the most compelling people in the book  the rescue workers who risk their own lives to save such men On balance then  Mr  Knecht has written a book that's well worth reading and is truly gripping throughout the bulk of the action   That less might have been better does not diminish the quality of what's best here and at its best the book is very good GRADE   B+very good  GRADE   B+
Mr  Disch  a well regarded science fiction writer  poet  playwright  and critic  here gives us a critical history of the scifi genre that resembles nothing so much as a drive-by shooting   When he's done  the field is lettered with the shattered reputations of the field's hacks (from John Norman to Newt Gingrich)  quacks (from L  Ron Hubbard to Whitley Streiber)  feminists (Ursula K  LeGuin & company)  fascists (Robert Heinlein)  technophiles (Greg Egan)  proselytizers (Orson Scott Card)  and so forth and so on   Among the offenses cited  besides bad writing  are a tendency to pander to the     fantasies of young men  a willingness to exploit things like UFO crazes and apocalyptic beliefs  extreme right-wing politics  extreme left-wing politics  dumbing down for the mass audience  jargoning up for the academic crowd  employing ludicrous science  jingoism  racism      speciesism  etc   Hardly anyone comes off well--himself  H G  Wells  Philip K  Dick  J G  Ballard  Iain M  Banks  Joe Haldeman and a very few more  plus Edgar Allan Poe gets an ambivalent nod  given credit not only for inventing science fiction but for embodying it entire in his work  both its good and its bad aspects Mr  Disch is particularly drawn to Poe as perpetrator of  hoaxes  a talent he think central to science fiction   In fact  he believes lying to be central to our national character   America is a nation of liars  and for that reason science fiction has a special claim to be our national literature   as the art form best adapted to telling the lies we like to hear and to pretend we believe In Mr  Disch's view  Poe and his successors mastered the art of telling people what they want to believe   And in stories like Mesmeric Revelation and The Facts in the Case of M  Valdemar  he finds Poe to have anticipated nearly every theme that would be developed by subsequent writers   1  Mesmerism  2  Dreams come true  3  Chip-on-the-shoulder superiority  4  Genuine visionary power  5  Great special effects  6  Sophomoric humor  7  Divine madnessOver the course of the book he shows how these themes have been employed for good and ill  by various writers  the overwhelming majority of whom he believes have exploited their readers dreams without living up to the admonition that forms the title of Delmore Schwartz's first collection of poems  In Dreams Begin Responsibilities  which Mr  Disch alludes to in the title of this book   Too often he finds his subjects dodging responsibility in favor of popularity  easy money  fadishness  and personal political predilections Inevitably the folks who come off worst here are the fans who let authors get away with this stuff   At best Mr  Disch portrays them as kind of reminiscent of the guys from your high school's A V  club  with delusions of superpowered children  women who want to be dominated and alien races just waiting to be wiped out   At worst  they're militiamen like those from the Oklahoma City bombing or the members of the Heaven's Gate or Aum Shinrikyo cults   That is  they're totally gullible  susceptible to either homicidal or suicidal suggestion   And always they're the oft-caricatured geeky losers who attend Star Trek conventions As you can tell by now  this is a very dark vision of science fiction--one of the rare bright spots (according to Mr  Disch anyway) coming when it helped us learn to live with the atom bomb  Equally bleak is his prediction for the future  when movies and television  now that their effects can match our imaginations  take over from books   In the end what keeps us reading  even as he's telling us that most of what we're reading about is junk  is the quality of Mr  Disch's analysis and the sheer bravado with which he attacks his own peers  predecessors  and heirs   There's something here to alienate just about every reader  but the very equal opportunity nature of the drubbings he administers makes it hardto stay mad   If he's laying into an author you like or a political philosophy you admire  have no fear  on the next page he'll have moved on to authors and ideas you loathe   One admires the high moral seriousness to which he summons science fiction  but despairs as he says it's not happened in the past and isn't going to happen in the future   He kind of reminds you of the American colonel in Vietnam who opined    "We had to destroy the village to save it  "  except that Mr  Disch adds that the village is doomed anyway   This may be too upsetting for scifi fanatics but for the casual fan or the merely curious reader it's an enjoyable performance to behold GRADE  B-gs he administers makes it hard to stay mad   If he's laying into an author you like or a political philosophy you admire  have no fear  on the next page he'll have

First  let me state unequivocally that this is an immensely enjoyable book   Creating an alter ego  Dr  Tatiana  who's a sex advice columnist to the animal world  Olivia Judson offers numerous fascinating examples of the myriad bizarre and entertaining ways in which bugs  fish  birds  and mammals (and a few other things) procreate   The format of the book  with her answering nervous letters from various creatures  is derived from a column she wrote for The Economist in 1997 and it allows her to keep the discussion light and sometimes very funny     The humorous style allows her to explore sexual strategies like adultery  rape  murder  cannibalism  asexualism  homosexuality  etc   without getting too bogged down in their broader implications   That latter point though leads to what will be an equivocation It seems  particularly in light of the anthropomorphism that Ms Judson utilizes  like this survey of the sexual mores of other species is ultimately intended to inform our understanding of the various practices we humans engage in   If not strictly suggested by the humanized manner in which she presents her case studies  it is certainly implicated in her conclusion   I hope that having seen the prodigious variety of sexual practices out there  you'll be more tolerant of the predilections of others This hope is hardly justified by what has come before   Even if we grant for the nonce that Ms Judson has demonstrated that evolutionary pressures have created a wide range of reproductive strategies  a   "predilection  " is a mere preference for something  Assuming that evolution is sound science  animals respond to an overwhelming force of nature; they don't just pick and choose sexual behaviors because they seem like fun; only humans have this privilege Taken at face value  Ms Judson's point might invite us to broaden our minds to the point where Jeffrey Dahmer's cannibalism may be tolerated as just another in a wide range of entirely natural sexual practices   Or rape could be accepted as just an evolutionary adaptation; indeed  evolutionary psychologists have proposed that this may be the case   If Ms Judson is trying to suggest that any behavior we can find in another species deserves our tolerance  she really ought to have made a sustained argument  rather than  in effect  just saying that this stuff happens therefore it's natural  therefore it should be tolerated   If she's not suggesting any such thing  then one wonders what the purpose of the book is If it's just a titillating entertainment that's fine  because it is very entertaining   But if we are supposed to be able to draw any conclusions from the book  the simple fact that neither survival nor reproduction appear to offer much challenge for modern humans would seem to mitigate against the idea that aberrant behaviors are anything more than mere preferences   Factor in the unique human soul and our free will and it seems fair to ask why the exercise of personal preferences should not be subject to moral judgment Ultimately  Ms Judson overreaches her material  but not before she's made reading the book worth our while GRADE  B-exual practices   Or rape could be accepted as just an evolutionary adaptation; indeed  evolutionary psychologists have proposed that this may be the case   If Ms Judson is trying to suggest that any behavior we can find in another species deserves our tolerance  she really ought to have made a sustained argument  rather than  in effect  just saying that this stuff happens therefore it's natural  therefore it should be tolerated   If she's not suggesting any such thing  then one wonders what the purpose of the book is  If it's just a titillating entertainment that's fine  because it is very entertaining   But if we are supposed to be able to draw any conclusions from the book  the simple fact that neither survival nor reproduction appear to offer much challenge for modern humans would seem to mitigate against the idea that aberrant behaviors are anything more than mere preferences   Factor in the unique human soul and our free will and it seems fair to ask why the exercise of personal preferences should not be subject to moral judgment  Ultimately  Ms Judson overreaches her material  but not before she's made reading the book worth our while  GRADE  B-
Loathe as I am to admit it now that I do know  I have to say that I'd never heard of Hayim Nahman Bialik until Mr  Hadari contacted us  Nor  I suspect  have many of you  This is an injustice  one that Mr  Hadari's translations can hopefully help to right Hayim (or Chaim) Nahman Bialik is considered the national poet of Israel  even though he died before the state was founded  He is also considered one of the greatest Hebrew poets ever  In fact  one of his achievements was to restore Hebrew as the language of Jewish poetry  rather than the Yiddish that had become more common  Bialik was born in Radi  Russia  and was raised there and in Zhitomir  by a scholarly father and  upon his father's death  by a stern and scholarly grandfather  Upon reaching adulthood he lived off and on in Odessa which  unlike other Russian cities which forbade them  had a sizable population of Jews (including fellow writers like Isaac Babel  Ze'ev Jabotinsky  and Ahad Ha'am  a Zionist who was one of Bialik's mentors)  Bialik worked in business  as a teacher  as an editor  and finally as a publisher  He traveled in Europe and to what was then Palestine  After the Communist Revolution in Russia  when he came under suspicion for his writings  Bialik moved first to Germany and then to Tel Aviv where he was buried after dying in Vienna following an operation in 1934  Over the course of his career he translated Jewish folk tales  wrote Zionist essays and wrote his own poems (though not many after 1916)  It was these last that made his name  And it was one specific poem that made him a central figure in the history of Zionism Living in Czarist Russia  he witnessed at first hand the brutal treatment of the Jewish people  In particular  he visited the city of Kishinev (modern day Chisinau  Moldova) after the 1903 pogrom in which 50 Jews were murdered Ê Fueled by anger both at what had been done and at the inadequacy of Jewish response  he wrote his greatest poem  the one with which Mr  Hadari begins the collection   City of the Killings (1903)  I wish I could find the whole thing on-line because it's unbelievably powerful   From his own comments in the Translator's Note and from Dan Miron's Introduction  it sounds like Mr  Hadari has focussed more on capturing the spirit and the rhythms of the poems  than trying to artificially preserve exact rhymes and wordings     "If a poem is mostly words--and fancy words at that--there's precious little there  What I look for is attack  as Derek Walcott would put it-- it's not enough to know what the word means  though that helps; one needs to also get a sense of the spin on the word--so that if I take liberties  with the translation  to take the necessary liberty of translation that results in the flight of the new poem  I must have a sense of the bias  of the material; as may be the case in the treatment by the novelist of historical material  or indeed the treatment by a historian of that same material--he uses historical material but it's the bias of his treatment that's interesting  just like the historian's choice of facts determining the portrait; so with the poem  if the feeling charging the words is absent  if the feeling in fact doesn't overwhelm the language  like a current  making the touch of the actual line dangerous  there's no poem to prepare--no song that can be rephrased in English; the translator is  finally  a harmonizer with the lead vocal; in the prime moments he is reproducing the singer  in the same key  with variations  in another language   That is the problem  to find the same rhythms  near the same sense  and with the right emotional current  If there's no current  how can you possibly begin to raise your voice? Let alone if the words resist comprehension  and the rhythm stutters    "Not knowing the originals  nor any Hebrew  I've no idea how successful he's been in this task  but I do know that Mr  Hadari's translations tap into a rich emotional current and get you toraise your voice  Whether or not it's precisely Bialik's spirit  they're certainly spirited  Mr  Hadari's done a great service by making the poetry of Bialik accessible to the wider audience the great poet deserves to raise your voice  Whether or not it's precisely Bialik's spirit  they're certainly spirited  Mr  Hadari's done a great service by making the poetry of Bialik accessible to the wider audience the great poet deserves 
In a book that starts quickly then settles in for a long buildup before finishing with a rush  Greg Bear tells the story of the political tensions that develop between an Earth that seeks unity and its recalcitrant young colony on Mars   The narrator  Casseia Majumdar had dreamed of an independent Mars since participating in a student rebellion in 2171   Her quest led her into politics and eventually to a momentous decision when the final confrontation with Earth came   Meanwhile  her one time lover  Charles Franklin  had an intuition that the universe is basically a matrix of information and that by tweaking the flow of data we might be able to alter reality   It is his work that scares Earth enough to force it to act   Together the two  quite literally  change the course of Mars Though the novel could use an aggressive trimming and the setting seems not to have much depth to it  what makes the book so compelling is that Mr  Bear in some ways really just replays the core dilemmas of Western Civilization in outer space  particularly the competing desires for freedom or security   Earth has become a place where people utilize mind and body enhancements  where they eagerly embrace psychological therapies  and where the aversion to conflict and the impulse towards homogeneity is so great that people link their minds together and/or link up with computers (thinkers)   Mars is far more individualistic and natural and resistant to this dull sameness   At one point  on a trip to Earth to negotiate a treaty  Casseia has the following &quot;discussion&quot; with a thinker named alice (after Alice in Wonderland)    &quot;Eventually  human groups and thinkers could be so integrated as to be indistinguishable   At that point  such a society exceeds my modeling ability &quot; Alice concluded   &quot;Group mind &quot; I said sardonically  &quot;I don't want to be there when that happens &quot;  &quot;It would be intriguing &quot; Alice said  &quot;There would always remain the choice to simulate isolation as an individual &quot;  &quot;But then you'd be lonely &quot; I said  with a sudden hitch in my voice   Perversely  I yearned for some sort of connection with agreement and  certainty--to truly belong to a larger truth  a greater  unified effort   My Martian upbringing  my youth and personality  kept me isolated  and in constant longing   I deeply wished to belong to a just and higher cause  to have people--friends--who understood me   To not be lonely   In a few clumsy  halting sentences  I expressed this to Alice as if she were a confidant and not an examiner   &quot;You understand the urge &quot; Alice told me  [   ]  &quot;The wish to belong to something greater is an historical force  recognized  sometimes fought against  but regarded by many as inevitable &quot;  &quot;Scary &quot;It may be that the degree to which you enjoy the book is determined by just how scary you find the specter of such &quot;belonging&quot;   But the insight here is excellent   It's the divide we see in our literature  from E  M  Forster's &quot;Only connect   &quot; on the one side to Huck Finn's dream of &quot;lighting out for the Territory&quot; on the other   If you're pro-Territory  you'll like the book GRADE   B+aid  &quot;There would always remain the choice to simulate isolation as an individual &quot;     &quot;But then you'd be lonely &quot; I said  with a sudden hitch in my voice   Perversely  I yearned for some sort of connection with agreement and <BR>    certainty--to truly belong to a larger truth  a greater  unified effort   My Martian upbringing  my youth and personality  kept me isolated <BR>    and in constant longing   I deeply wished to belong to a just and higher cause  to have people--friends--who understood me   To not be lonely  <BR>    In a few clumsy  halting sentences  I expressed this to Alice as if she were a confidant and not an examiner      &quot;You understand the urge &quot; Alice told me  [   ]     &quot;The wish to belong to something greater is an historical force  recognized  sometimes fought against  but regarded by many as inevitable &quot;     &quot;Scary &quot; It may be that the degree to which you enjoy the book is determined by just how scary you find the specter of such &quot;belonging&quot;   But the insight here is excellent   It's the divide we see in our literature  from E  M  Forster's &quot;Only connect   &quot; on the one side to Huck Finn's dream of &quot;lighting out for the Territory&quot; on the other   If you're pro-Territory  you'll like the book  GRADE   B+
Murder mysteries  both fiction and non-fiction  are generally driven by one of three questions  or by some combination thereof   (1) Who done it?; (2) How'd they do it?; and/or (3) Why'd they do it?  One of the things that makes John Taylor's The Count and the Confession so engaging is that the true-life crime at its core not only involves all three of these questions but  remarkably enough  a rarely asked fourth question   Was there even a murder?  There's certainly a body   In 1992  Roger de la Burde--a thoroughgoing scoundrel  though he styled himself a Polish count--was found dead in his locked Powhatan County  Virginia house with a single gunshot wound to the head and the proverbial smoking gun in his hand   To all appearances it was a case of suicide  but eventually his lover of thirteen years  Beverly Monroe  would be convicted of his murder  a verdict aided greatly by Ms Monroe's own confession that she was present when the gun fired Over the course of the book  as Mr  Taylor walks back the cat on this case  two elements emerge as the keys to what may well have been a miscarriage of justice   First he explores the deplorable character of Roger de la Burde  who in addition to not actually being a count was also a serial womanizer--having left his wife for Ms Monroe and having impregnated another woman at the time of his death  among his many sexual exploits--and a dealer in bogus artworks   He was also mired in a lawsuit with his former employer  Phillip Morris  which seems to have been a groundless attempt to extort money from them   He was also extraordinarily manipulative   One of the of the highlights of the book is his will  which is a model of self-absorption  judgmentalism  and how not to treat your daughters   All of this makes him pretty entertaining to read about but it's surpassing hard to mind that he's dead  whether by his own hand or at that of another Meanwhile  Beverly Monroe captivates us because on the one hand she seems reasonably pulled together  well-educated  financially independent  seemingly a good mom   But on the other  she tolerated de la Burde's shenanigans  including knowing that he was trying to have a   "male heir  " by just about any woman who was willing  and she made that confession   And that's the second element that Mr  Taylor focuses on   why would beverly Monroe confess to being there when de la Burde died if she wasn't?It is here that a sort of villain emerges  David Riley  chief investigator for the county   Riley determined to his own satisfaction that the position in which de la Burde was lying and the way he was holding the gun indicated not suicide but murder and he settled upon Beverly Monroe as the culprit   He then used a variety of techniques  from a lie detector test that he informed her she'd failed to commiserating about how badly de la Burde had treated her to threats about how the prosecution might portray her to an oft repeated  nearly hypnotic suggestion that  even if she didn't kill him  she must have been there when de la Burde died   When she accepted this last scenario and made it her own  it enabled the state to portray her as a murderess once they used forensic evidence to rule out suicide As Mr  Taylor shows though  and as her lawyers were able to show on appeal  it seems unlikely that she was in the room at the time and there is significant reason to doubt the evidence that the state purported to show that de la Burde did not fire the shot that killed him   In fact  Ms Monroe's appeal was eventually successful and she has been released from prison pending further appeal by the state   However  even if we accept that she did not kill de la Burde--and the author  though he does not slip into advocacy does make it hard for us to believe anything other than that it was a suicide--in the end  we come back to the central mysteries   the count and the confession Towards the end of the book Mr  Taylor recounts a moment where Beverly Monroe's original attorney  Murray Janus  is reflecting on the reasons he lost at trial    After all these years  Janus still could not believe that Beverly had given those statements to Dave Riley   They were tantamount to a confession   Why she did it was truly a mystery  second only to the mystery of how Roger de la Burde had died That this moment comes so late in the proceedings and that even then we join in Janus's wonderment at these two mysteries  suggests why Mr  Taylor's story works so well   For by then we kind of know the answer to two of those classic murder mystery questions   We know why someone would have killed de la Burde and we know how it might have been done (a jury bought it anyway)   But we still don't know who killed Roger de la Burde and we really have to doubt that anyone did   It seems a simple case of suicide gone horribly wrong in the hands of an overzealous investigator   And Beverly Monroe seems to have been  as she was so often and maddeningly during his life  a victim of de la Burde's misbehavior and her own malleability   But if her continual acquiescence in that misbehavior makes her somewhat unsympathetic early on in the tale--just as it makes him wholly unsympathetic--then the grace with which she handles the conviction and the determination with which she and even more so her daughter  Katie  fight the appeal serve to redeem her   Even if you're ambivalent about her at first  as I have to admit I was  you'll be rooting for Beverly Monroe by the end GRADE   A-Monroe's original attorney  Murray Janus  is reflecting on the reasons he lost at trial       After all these years  Janus still

Though Mr  D'Este does not play up this angle as fully as he might have  Eisenhower's real greatness  in historical terms  may lie in his nearly Washingtonian democratic reserve   Today we take for granted the notion that the military is subject to civilian control and that even great victors will yield to their elected commanders in Washington   In this assumption we do a disservice to history and to the remarkable men who've served us  for there is nothing less common in the bloody epoch of warfare than for a conquering army and its leader to quietly return home without making any demands first   Whether through luck  through the genius of the system  or through God's   "special providence  "  America has been blessed with generals who have asked nothing for themselves despite winning stupendous victories   Eisenhower not only joins the long list of American heroes in this regard--which includes Washington  Grant  and Pershing--he also  as Mr  D'Este does make clear  was willing time and again to set aside his own strategic judgments in favor of those of the political branch   This becomes clearest in the run up to the fall of Berlin  when  despite his own doubts about the Soviets  Eisenhower held off American forces  at the behest of Washington  in order that the Russians might take the city   Though he might have fought the point harder had he not been ambivalent about the value of the city as propaganda and its worth as a military asset  it is nonetheless the case  as Mr  D'Este shows  that Eisenhower considered such decisions to be ultimately political and therefore above his pay grade   Thus  his greatness as a hero of democracy On the other hand  there is a high price to be paid when what are also necessarily military questions are left entirely to the political class and the world was to pay an enormous cost  and Eisenhower was to pay it in his presidency  for clinging to the delusion that the Soviet Union was a reliable ally   If Eisenhower did not comprehend on the intellectual level--as did military geniuses like Patton  Curtis LeMay  and Churchill--that a reckoning with the Soviets was absolutely essential  he appears  from Mr  D'Este's somewhat contradictory account  to have felt it in his guts   Had he turned to the best military thinkers he may well have followed those instincts  but in accepting the views of politicos instead he effectively sentenced the world to a fifty year Cold War   Thus his tragedy  that in doing what was clearly right from a democratic standpoint  he did great harm to that democracy and the rest of the world   He is then  at one and the same time  blameless and blameworthy   There is no easy answer to how he might have done otherwise  though Mr  D'Este does drop some hints Even at that early stage there was already significant tension between the Americans and the Russians and it seems possible  maybe even likely  that had Eisenhower simply given his commanders in the field somewhat freer reign they would have come into contact and then conflict with their Soviet counterparts   Likewise  had Patton just been given the go ahead he'd have taken Berlin and provoked a firestorm  possibly a literal one  with the Soviet Union   In this regard  there's an especially poignant moment in the book    [E]isenhower revealed privately to Patton that he was soon to halt the First and Ninth Armies at the Elbe River to await the arrival of the Red  Army   Third Army would be given a new mission to drive southeast toward Czechoslovakia     "From a tactical point of view  it is highly  inadvisable for the American Army to take Berlin and I hope political influence won't cause me to take the city   " he said     "It has no tactical  or strategic value and would place upon the American forces the burden of caring for thousands and thousands of Germans  displaced persons  and Allied prisoners of war   "  Patton's reaction was incredulity     "Ike  I don't see how you figure that out   We had better take Berlin  and quick--and on to the Oder!  "  Later on  in the presence of his chief of staff  Patton reiterated the need to drive on to Berlin  arguing that it could certainly be done in  forty-eight hours by Ninth Army   Eisenhower  wondered aloud    "Well  who would want it?  "  Patton did not reply at once  but placed both  hands on his friend's shoulders and said    "I think history will answer that question for you   "Now even if Ike was not always as obtuse on the question as his statements to Patton suggest (one assumes he may have felt he needed to be overly direct with Patton) and even if his decision was defensible given the time and the place  who today can reasonably quarrel with Patton's devastating judgment?  Certainly the amount of room that Mr  D'Este devotes to discussing General Eisenhower's decisions in regard to the Soviets suggests that even a favorably disposed biographer suspects that history agrees with Patton  not Ike So  in a fitting sense  the tragedy of Eisenhower is that the very thing that made him great  his democratic nature  made what should have been the pinnacle of his career into a far more ambiguous moment   As important as the defeat of the Nazis was  by leaving the Soviets in control of Russia and the East  we essentially swapped one form of totalitarianism for another  thus calling into question the very point of the war   But it is one of the tragic flaws of democracy (or at least of American democracy) that the deaths of its citizens are so horrible to contemplate that even once provoked into war there's an overwhelming tendency to end the war before it's been fought to completion  a tendency that frequently makes the peace worse than the further war that was avoided   Just in the 20th Century the United States too soon put an end to hostilities--nearly always unilaterally--in WWI  WWII  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq  and Somalia   Eisenhower may then be seen to have reflected what is best and what is least fortunate about the democratic way of waging war  making him both the quintessential American soldier and a paradoxical figure of tragedy GRADE   Ayou figure that out   We had better take Berlin  and quick--and on to the Oder!

Certainly the amount of room that Mr  D'Este devotes to discussing General Eisenhower's decisions in regard to the Soviets suggests that even a favorably disposed biographer suspects that history agrees with Patton  not Ike  So  in a fitting sense  the tragedy of Eisenhower is that the very thing that made him great  his democratic nature  made what should have been the pinnacle of his career into a far more ambiguous moment   As important as the defeat of the Nazis was  by leaving the Soviets in control of Russia and the East  we essentially swapped one form of totalitarianism for another  thus calling into question the very point of the war   But it is one of the tragic flaws of democracy (or at least of American democracy) that the deaths of its citizens are so horrible to contemplate that even once provoked into war there's an overwhelming tendency to end the war before it's been fought to completion  a tendency that frequently makes the peace worse than the further war that was avoided   Just in the 20th Century the United States too soon put an end to hostilities--nearly always unilaterally--in WWI  WWII  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq  and Somalia   Eisenhower may then be seen to have reflected what is best and what is least fortunate about the democratic way of waging war  making him both the quintessential American soldier and a paradoxical figure of tragedy  GRADE   A
It is not too much to say that men like William Kidd made me a reader  and one suspects the same is true for many of my generation   In 5thGrade an especially wise teacher exploited a glimmer of interest in explorers and pirates to get me to read just about every book I could find on the great European Age of Exploration and the attendant age of piracy   From Columbus to Ponce de Leon to LaSalle to Drake  I read them all with the promiscuity of the new enthusiast   Of course  one thing led to another and soon novels like Swiss Family Robinson and Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe and the Hornblower books were stacked up on bookshelves like planes at a busy airport  waiting their turns to land and disgorge their contents  And then you had the movies   besides versions of the books above you had Peter Pan  Mutiny on the Bounty  Captain Blood   and  of course  Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952)  with Charles Laughton  better remembered as Captain Bligh  reprising his role from Captain Kidd   Even Cap'n Crunch cereal fed a kids fantasies of taking to the sea in a wooden ship and finding adventure there   Thus did sailing men  even the rascals and dastards among them  like Captain Kidd  light a fire in at least one young mind All of which makes it a particularly pleasant experience to read this entertaining and authoritative rehabilitation of Kidd by Richard Zacks   As Mr  Zacks shows in exhaustive  and perhaps a bit exhausting  detail  William Kidd was not really the scoundrel pirate of legend but a duly deputized privateer  sent out to capture pirates in exchange for a share of their loot  It was only through a series of unfortunate mishaps and the repeated intervention of a hitherto uncelebrated nemesis  Robert Culliford  that Kidd himself came to be accused of piracy and ended up dangling from the end of a rope   Mr  Zacks relates the sorrowful tale of Kidd's 1696 expedition  that set out from Manhattan aboard the Adventure Galley but ended on a London gallows in 1701 Mr  Zacks is a zealous advocate for Kidd's innocence and his passion is contagious   But Kidd makes for a doomed and tragic hero  what with a mutinous crew  an unsturdy ship  feckless backers  and the bedeviling presence time and again of his rival  Culliford  Kidd's behavior  as presented here  is genuinely admirable  particularly his determination to clear his name after he'd been wrongly accused of piracy in the taking of two ships   Kidd essentially put his own neck in the noose by sailing back to New York to face the charges It was in New York that the legend that he'd hidden his treasure arose  and Mr  Zacks shows us why   In fact  this is just one of many myths and legends that Mr  Zacks lays to rest  but part of what makes the book so enchanting is that the truths he reveals are just as compelling as the fictions they replace   In particular  despite the enduring image of ruthless captains wielding iron discipline  it's interesting to discover just how democratic the pirate society really was   But no truth is more beguiling than the real life Captain Kidd who we're introduced to   If the book is a bit too long and too minute by minute  which I believe to be the case  it is nonetheless carried along by Kidd and by our desire  though we know it futile  to see justice done him and barring that  our almost equally strong desire to see Culliford and some of the others who wronged Kidd get their comeuppances  But few do and as for Kidd    William Kidd  born in Dundee  married in New York  hanged in London  was then hoisted in chains onto the oak gibbet at Tilbury   For years  afterward  men and women aboard all ships going to and coming from the trading metropolis of London could see him there swaying in the  breezes  the Admiralty's stark warning to anyone contemplating the merry life of piracy The poor benighted Captain would have to wait three hundred years for Richard Zacks to come along and set the record straight  which with the help of a painstakingly assembled historical record and a key piece of evidence uncovered in 1911 in the dense thickets of the British bureaucracy he does GRADE   A-nd set the record straight  which with the help of a painstakingly assembled historical record and a key piece of evidence uncovered in 1911 in the dense thickets of the British bureaucracy he does  GRADE   A-
I'm unashamed to admit that my perceptions of several historical crises--especially Suez and the Cuban Missile Crisis--are shaped by rhetorical asides in the novels of James Clavell   Mr  Clavell  in Noble House  convincingly portrays both as catastrophes for the West   The result of the Missile Crisis was that JFK promised that the U S  would no longer try to topple Castro   Forty years later we see the foolishness of that pledge   Meanwhile  in the Suez Crisis  America gratuitously humiliated its own democratic allies  ending even the illusion that Britain and France were still significant geopolitical players  while boosting a Middle Eastern dictator Hugh Thomas--who in later years has published a series of monumental and excellent histories including Conquest   Montezuma  Cortes  and the Fall of Old Mexico and The Slave Trade--in this shortish but thorough account of the whole balls up  lays much of the blame at the feet of John Foster Dulles and a U S  State Department that was hostile to what it mistakenly perceived as British neocolonialism   But he also reserves healthy shares of  blame for Ike  who let Dulles his way and failed to communicate clearly that he too opposed the adventure  and for the French and British governments (especially Prime Minister Anthony Eden) who erroneously believed that Ike was still the ally they remembered from WWII Basically the Israelis sought to destroy the Egyptian military threat but also to occupy the Sinai and Gaza and the French and British sought to put a stop to the rise of Islamic nationalism  which had just seen Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal (July 26  1956)   Military operations  begun by the Israelis on October 29  went fairly smoothly  though by simply sinking ships in the canal Nasser was easily able to make it impassable   However  Eisenhower was infuriated  not least because he was facing re-election in a few days and had not wanted to have to rebuke Israel at the risk of losing Jewish votes in New York   Accordingly  the U S  sponsored a UN cease-fire resolution on November 1   The Brits  French and Israelis withdrew and UN peace keeping forces took over supervision of the Sinai and the Gaza Strip   In the meantime  the Soviets brutally repressed the Hungarian Revolt in early November   So whatever Eisenhower and Dulles may have thought they'd accomplish  the result was to make it look like the Soviets had forced a withdrawal in the Middle East while crushing internal problems  thereby elevating them  and at the same time France and Britain would never again act on their own   Having had the lost illusions of great power stripped away  they became virtual dependents of the U S    Even more disastrous for all concerned  these events gave added impetus to the movement for European Union and resulted in the creation of the Common Market  the initial step towards the centralized  bureaucratic nightmare that is now descending on Europe Mr  Thomas  writing from a mostly British perspective  is deeply dubious about the plausibility of the plan and the rather undemocratic and deceptive way in which Eden's government prepared  presented and pursued it   Perhaps his most valid criticism of the entire operation is that there was really no planning for what might follow a Nasser government if things went that far   Still  with the wisdom of hindsight  it's hard to believe things in the Middle East would be any worse today if the West had established in the 50s that it would not allow the rise of governments that were openly hostile to its interests   And it certainly might have prevented much subsequent misery if the U S  had allowed its allies to continue their mission while we dealt with the Soviets  intervening on Hungary's behalf   Instead  the Cold War was allowed to drag on for another thirty years and even forty-five years on we're still dealing with the problem of Islamicist governments in the Middle East   Even if Mr  Thomas is right and the Suez takeover was ill-considered and unlikely to be a permanent solution to the problem of Egypt  it certainly seems that the American intervention to end operations prematurely made a potentially bad situation much worse   What a mess GRADE   B+er was ill-considered and unlikely to be a permanent solution to the problem of Egypt  it certainly seems that the American intervention to end operations prematurely made a potentially bad situation much worse   What a mess GRADE   B+
This excellent primer on homeschooling  by journalist and homeschooler Isabel Lyman  presents a history of the movement and an exploration ofthe variety of issues confronting parents who may wish to teach their kids themselves   In the book  which grew out of an essay for the Cato Institute  HOMESCHOOLING   Back to the Future?  she looks at legal issues  the size and shape of the homeschool movement in America  questions about socialization of kids and meeting educational standards  resources that are available for families who choose this option  and even what kind of social acceptance or pressures folks may face   Ms Lyman also uses copious real-life examples to show how others have met and overcome these challenges  as well as sharing her own experiences   In all  it's an excellent overview of an emerging phenomena My one quibble is actually with the manner in which she tells the true stories   It may be a function of the book being a couple years old  and that we're more used to the notion of homeschooling now  or of the aftereffects of battles Ms Lyman may have had to wage personally  or maybe I'm just naive  but the tone of some of the book  especially in these vignettes  is more defensive than it needs to be   There's a quality of here of &quot;look this kid was homeschooled and  ta-da   he turned out fine &quot;  There may well have been a time in this country where homeschooling was so shocking that thesekinds of assurances were necessary  but hopefully we''re long past that day   Ms Lyman and her fellow homeschoolers have exciting stories to tell  stories of which they are  and should be  immensely proud   They need not justify the choices they've made   The achievements of their children are ample justification   If anything it is many of those who run our public schools who need to explain what they've done to education in the last few decades Ms Lyman is an effective proselytizer for a movement she obviously cares deeply about  If you are one of those folks who are still dubiousabout the efficacy of homeschooling  she'll more than allay your doubts  If you have kids she'll make you think hard about the options availableto you   If you''re thinking about homeschooling she'll more than likely convince you to do so   But always  as befits someone who is advocatingfreedom of choice  she encourages parents to do what they think is right for their own kids   Perhaps most refreshingly  Ms Lyman writes on behalf of a social/political movement that does not ask for anything from the rest of us--no tax money  no special favors  etc --except that we accept their decisions to homeschool as a viable alternative for educating American kids   As she argues convincingly and as test scores and other data demonstrate  homeschooling is not only viable it can be a fabulous choice for families with the determination to succeed GRADE   B+f you are one of those folks who are still dubious <BR>about the efficacy of homeschooling  she'll more than allay your doubts  If you have kids she'll make you think hard about the options available <BR>to you   If you''re thinking about homeschooling she'll more than likely convince you to do so   But always  as befits someone who is advocating <BR>freedom of choice  she encourages parents to do what they think is right for their own kids   Perhaps most refreshingly  Ms Lyman writes on behalf of a social/political movement that does not ask for anything from the rest of us--no tax money  no special favors  etc --except that we accept their decisions to homeschool as a viable alternative for educating American kids   As she argues convincingly and as test scores and other data demonstrate  homeschooling is not only viable it can be a fabulous choice for families with the determination to succeed  GRADE   B+
Steve Hamilton's debut entry in the Alex McKnight won both the Shamus and Edgar awards for best first novel   McKnight is a former Detroit policeman now living in the Upper Penninsula town of Paradise   He was shot three times--one of the bulletts remains lodged near his heart--and his partner killed  by a madman named Maximillian Rose   Now  as McKinight reluctantly investigates the killing of two local bookies  it seems that Rose  who is supposed to be in prison  has entered his life again Mr  Hamilton offers a mildly unconventional P  I  in McKnight  who is still openly traumatized by his shooting  and the encounter with Rose generally  and who is carrying on an affair with his friend and client's wife   These two facets of the novel are apparently what grabbed folks' attention   Personally  I thought they made McKnight rather off-putting   Detectives like Lew Archer were pretty routinely frightened by the plight of their clients and would routinely fall in love with one or more of the women involved in the case  even if married--Sam Spade was even getting his phreak on with his partner's wife at the beginning of The Maltese Falcon   So  it's hard to see these twists as particularly unusual and once you take away the novelty factor you're left with a competent but somewhat formulaic Thomas Harris copy  right down to the prison confrontation  and a detective who's hard to root for GRADE   C

The first movie tie-in that I can recall reading was a Star Wars novelization in Spring of '76  before any of us had even really heard about themovie   At first I just assumed that the George Lucas had based his film on the book  but it gradually dawned that  to the contrary  the screenplay had been the source of a quickie book   (As I recall  the book is credited to Lucas  but I think Alan Dean Foster actually wrote it ) It seemed sort of like a rip-off to me even at an early age and I've been suspicious of books that are also movies ever since   So when I found this one  with scenes from the fine Jimmy Stewart film on the cover and a big movie announcement on the back  I looked it over carefully to make sure that the book had come first   Imagine my surprise when a little research turned up the fact that not only was Elleston Trevor a well regarded author  but he was also the writer known as Adam Hall  who wrote the Quiller series of spy novels  the first of which  The Quiller Memorandum  was voted the 1965 Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America   Indeed  Elleston Trevor turns out to be a synonym too  for an Englishman  born Trevor Dudley Smith In Flight of the Phoenix  Elleston Trevor (for that was what he had his name legally changed to) gives us a harrowing tale of survival against the elements and human frailties in the Saharan desert   Fourteen men and a monkey  returning from the Libyan oilfields  live through a plane crash  but are left without food  water  or a radio  and because a sandstorm had blown them off course  no one is looking for them   The pilot  Frank Towns  is so caught up in justifiably blaming himself that he is nearly ready to give up   But his navigator  Lew Moran  coaxes him towards survival and mediates between the rest of the group and Stringer  a young  arrogant  and hypersensitive engineer who has figured out a way to cobble together a jerry-rigged smaller plane from the wreckage of the original   Stringer  though unbearably officious  is in all likelihood their only way out  if Moran can keep him from storming off in a fit of pique and keep the others from killing him Also among the survivors are Trucker Cobb  a chief driller being sent home from the fields because he's begun to lose his mind and Captain Harris  a gung-ho  by-the-book  British officer and several of his less enthusiastic men   There's also Roberts  who  in a gesture of insane but touching tenderness is giving his water ration to the monkey   Together they form an ill-matched group and as thirst  starvation  exposure  madness  and desperation turn up the torque  social order and morality and simple human decency are shunted aside and the men begin to turn on one another   The only thing that gives them some sense of purpose is the slender possibility that Stringer will somehow manage to salvage a workable plane and that Towns will get it together enough to fly them out Mr  Trevor keeps the action moving  but doesn't hesitate to draw out the tension  particularly between Stringer and Towns  the two men who are the equally important keys to survival  but who end up vying for authority over the group   This adds an element of Lord of the Flies to what would be a decent enough action yarn anyway   In this case at least  though the movie is now better remembered  the book holds up well as an exciting piece of fiction in its own right GRADE   B+though unbearably officious  is in all likelihood their only way out  if Moran can keep him from storming off in a fit of pique and keep the others from killing him  Also among the survivors are Trucker Cobb  a chief driller being sent home from the fields because he's begun to lose his mind and Captain Harris  a gung-ho  by-the-book  British officer and several of his less enthusiastic men   There's also Roberts  who  in a gesture of insane but touching tenderness is giving his water ration to the monkey   Together they form an ill-matched group and as thirst  starvation  exposure  madness  and desperation turn up the torque  social order and morality and simple human decency are shunted aside and the men begin to turn on one another   The only thing that gives them some sense of purpose is the slender possibility that Stringer will somehow manage to salvage a workable plane and that Towns will get it together enough to fly them out  Mr  Trevor keeps the action moving  but doesn't hesitate to draw out the tension  particularly between Stringer and Towns  the two men who are the equally important keys to survival  but who end up vying for authority over the group   This adds an element of Lord of the Flies to what would be a decent enough action yarn anyway   In this case at least  though the movie is now better remembered  the book holds up well as an exciting piece of fiction in its own right  GRADE   B+
White Noise tells the story of Jack Gladney  a professor of Hitler Studies at a small college  He's on his fourth wife  Babbette and has four kids and what I think most of us would say is an excessive fear of modern life and of his own death  Of the book Mr  DeLillo has said  [A]ll I can say about White Noise   is that the book is driven by a connection I sensed between advanced technology and contemporary fear  By the former I don't mean bombs and missiles alone but more or less everything -- microwaves  electrical insulation etc  One would have to write a long dense essay to explain this connection adequately -- that's why I wrote a loose-limbed and shadow-sliding work of fiction As it happens  Jack's fear of technology turns out to be justified when a toxic chemical cloud is unleashed in the area and he is terminally poisoned  But it is in his fear of death that I think Mr  DeLillo loses his way Jack fears death precisely because he believes in nothing  For such a person the self is all that matters  so the prospect of one's own death must be terrifying  For with your own death the world  for all intents and purposes  comes to an end  Your own death is the Apocalypse  Now  Jack has a friend  Murray Jay Siskind  who serves as kind of the Greek chorus of the book  When Jack is dying  Murray tells him    "I believe  Jack  there are two kinds of people in the world  Killers and diers  Most of us are diers  We don't have the disposition  the rage or whatever it takes to be a killer  We let death happen  We lie down and die  But think what it's like to be a killer  Think how exciting it is  in theory  to kill a person in direct confrontation  If he dies  you cannot  To kill him is to gain life credit  The more people you kill  the more  credit you store up  It explains any number ofÊ massacres  wars  executions   "This theory also explains much of the 20th century--from genocide to abortion--if we accept that murder has become a way for a people who no longer believe in anything beyond themselves to try to pretend that they have some kind of power over death  But it is of course a delusion  All the murders in the world--as Jack's subject  Hitler  demonstrates--won't extend your life by one minute  And even if they could  what would be the point  since we've already decided that our lives are meaningless?So what Mr  DeLillo has done here is to set up an elaborate joke  We can see how foolish these beliefs are and how destructive  It's clear that such theories  though intended to empower us  have left us empty; our lives dissatisfying; our mortality devastating  even though inevitable; and the morality which once gave our lives a sense of purpose discardedso that we may pursue personal pleasures which fail to fulfill  surely the point of the novel  after all this  must be that this is all a huge mistake  Right?

Our family came at this a little bit sideways   We picked up The Book That Jack Wrote first  mostly because the paintings by Daniel Adel are absolutelyextraordinary  though the rhyme  by Jon Scieszka  based on the classic The House that Jack Built  is fun too   Then I realized that Mr  Scieszka was the authorof both The Stinky Cheese Man  which you often see on recommended book lists  and The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs  which several other authors ofchildrens' books had chosen as one of their favorites in Salon Magazine several years ago   So now we own all three and read them almost every night It's somewhat absurd that we refer to the use of self-reference and the ironic blend of fact and fiction within fiction as post-modern  since such elements wereused in one of the first novels ever written  Don Quijote  and have never gone terribly far out of fashion since   Nor is childrens' literature a stranger to thesetechniques  as a generation of parents who were raised on Jay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales can well attest   But Mr  Scieszka is an adept practitioner of thestyle and it does tend to make kids' books easier for adults to read and enjoy The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs is written from the perspective of Alexander T  Wolf as he explains that the whole story is really just a bigmisunderstanding  mostly the result of sensationalistic journalism   Meanwhile  The Stinky Cheese Man is a rather more pungent version of the GingerbreadMan  who can't even get anyone to run  run  run as fast as they can to catch him because of the awful stench he gives off   The illustrations in these two  byLane Smith  are less stunning than those by Mr  Adel in The Book That Jack Wrote  but go well with the somewhat manic mood of the stories You can't go wrong with any of the three  but be warned  your kids will require repeated readings of each or all Book that Jack Wrote    Text   B  Paintings   A+True Story of the 3 Little Pigs and Stinky Cheese Man   Text   A  Illustrations   BStory of the 3 Little Pigs and Stinky Cheese Man   Text   A  Illustrations   B
To take just one example of the dilemma that Mr  Foner must confront as the Left loses control of history and of our institutions  let's look briefly at his essay&quot;Blacks and the U S  Constitution&quot;   Here he argues against the idea that judges should be bound by the text of the Constitution  arguing instead that it shouldbe an &quot;active advocate for the rights of disadvantaged Americans&quot; as it basically was in the 50s  60s  and 70s   Unfortunately  he contradicts himself so baldly asto render his point incoherent   Here he is rejecting adherence to the text    In an age of semiotics and deconstruction  not to mention intense debate among historians about the prevailing ideas of the revolutionary era   there is something refreshingly naive  almost quaint  in the idea that any text  including the Constitution  possesses a single  easily ascertainable   objective meaning On its face this is fairly unobjectionable   Were we still in an age when deconstruction and other Leftist philosophies  that seek to deny the plain meaning oflanguage and to expose the secret oppressive messages that straight white Christian males placed there  and were there a significant national debate over whatthe ideas of the Revolution were  then it would indeed be possible to say that the meaning of the Constitution is unknowable   It is  of course  a considerableimpediment to Mr  Foner's argument that the basic concept of deconstruction is practically unknown outside of the humanities departments of elite universitiesand that average Americans seem to feel that they pretty well understand the ideas of the Revolution  chief among which was that the laws that govern usshould be made by our elected representatives   But even more troublesome for Mr  Foner is his own admission a few pages later that    To those who came of age during the era of the Warren Court  it is easy to forget that the Supreme Court  expected by the founding fathers  to be the most conservative branch of the government  has amply fulfilled that role throughout most of our history   And today the Court  appears poised to revert to its traditional function Lo and behold  here's the good professor himself informing us that  far from being quaint or naive  the Right's belief that the judiciary was intended to be afundamentally conservative institution is consistent with both the expectations of the founding fathers and with long-standing tradition   In fact  as thesecontradictory statements reveal  the problem is not that history can't reveal to us the purposes of the drafters of the Constitution but that those purposes are atodds with Mr  Foner's purposes and at odds with the liberal departure from tradition that characterized the past several decades The question on the cover of the book may ask &quot;Who Owns History?&quot;  but the question that drives these essays is much more &quot;why don't we (The Left) own itanymore?&quot;   But Mr  Foner doesn't really make an honest attempt to answer either question and so the utility of the book is fairly limited   What we get insteadis a rather disconnected series of essays which in sum seem to argue merely that those who are now retaking ownership of history shouldn't be allowedto--whether they be non-communist historians in the former Soviet Union  black South Africans who are more interested in making social progress than inrehashing the past  PBS filmmakers seeking to honor the nation's bloody struggle to end slavery  or judges who think they should be bound by theConstitution   Ultimately  Mr  Foner's argument appears to be with American people themselves who &quot;often 'forget' that our history is not a Whiggishprogress toward greater and greater freedom and equality but a far more complex story   &quot;  Or it may be that since so many Americans (and I) believe it to bethe case that our history does in fact demonstrate just such Whiggish progress  that Mr  Foner's argument is with history itself GRADE   Fat our history does in fact demonstrate just such Whiggish progress  that Mr  Foner's argument is with history itself  GRADE   F
Though they differ in obvious ways  the political Left and the extreme-libertarian Right share one similarity   they are utopian  Both posit the notion that Man in the State of Nature led a peaceful and bucolic existence--for the Left a communal one  for the Right a rugged-individualist one--where want was unknown  evil did not exist  and no man coveted the goods of another  Where conservatism and Judeo-Christianty generally assume that Man carried a flaw (the capacity for sin) deep within himself  these two philosophies instead assume that it was artificial human institutions that corrupted Man  The Left believes that the problem is capitalism  The Right blames government  But both view these intermediary structures as having a baleful influence on the relationships among men and are certain that if they could only be removed we'd return to Paradise  It's entirely predictable then that Report from Iron Mountain  which began as a satire of capitalism and the military-industrial complex  ended up hoodwinking both Left and Right and becoming conspiracy fodder for the loons at both ends of the political spectrum The book is presented in the form of a secret report  prepared by an anonymous government commission  on the feasability of moving towards a society based on permanent peace instead of permanent war  At the heart of the hoax lies the patently absurd  but profoundly Leftist  idea that for capitalism to succeed the economy must be structured around governmental preparations for and prosecution of war  This is a concept that Paul M  Kennedy more than adequately debunked in his poorly timed but eminently worthwhile book  The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers  Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000 (1987)(Paul Kennedy 1945-)  But even a casual observer might have been expected to notice how rare a large military budget was in America's first 150 reasonably capitalist years and how poorly the economy was faring under the increasing strains of permanent war  At any rate  when the book came out  in 1967  its thesis meshed perfectly with the belief that the U S  was a war-mongering  imperialist  hegemony  Little wonder that Leonard Lewin's hoax--aided and abetted by folks like Victor Navasky  E  L  Doctorow  and J  K  Galbraith--was accepted by many as a genuine leak of a serious government report  Oliver Stone notoriously adopted the basic argument about capitalism requiring war as the rationale for why Kennedy was killed in the immensely silly film JFK If the problem Mr  Lewin identified appealed to the delusions of the Left though  the remedy he proposed played to the paranoia of the Right  particularly the latter-day militias and white separatists of the 1990s  For in the section of the report titled   "Substitutes for the Function of War  "  we are presented with an array of totalitarian government actions  up to and including a global police force  eugenics  and slavery  For guys who fear the black helicopters of the U N  this was music to their ears  So when the Feds descended on the militias after the Oklahoma City bombing  one of the surprising things they found was that a whole new generation of extremists  this time from the Right instead of the Left  had accepted the Report from Iron Mountain as the gospel truth The book is really most interesting for its hoax effect and for its demonstration of the odd convergence of Far Left and Far Right  It's an amusing curio  but not much more  It offers definitive proof that  as H  L  Mencken said (or nearly said)   no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people GRADE   Cpermanent war  At any rate  when the book came out  in 1967  its thesis meshed perfectly with the belief that

It's impossible to measure how many people this missive reached or the effect it had upon American opinion  It seems fair to say though that it did serve to demonize the Taliban (deservedly so) and helped Americans to distinguish between the oppressive government and the down trodden common people of Afghanistan  Perhaps most importantly  at a time when it might have been easy for an angry and frightened nation to take out its fury on its own Muslim population  this message showed that Muslim Americans were just as horrified by what had been done in the name of Islam as anyone else  At a moment when the visceral American reaction was inevitably to see Muslims as profoundly   "other  "  the e-mail was a reminder that no matter how different some aspects of their culture  Islamic immigrants were  and are  Americans too In this memoir  Tamim Ansary tells the story of growing up in Afghanistan and of the culture shock he endured moving from a traditional Muslim culture tomodern America  Improbably enough  Mr  Ansary's mother was American--his parents may have been the first Afghan man and American woman ever to marry  His father was a government official  so the family was reasonably well off by Afghani standards  living in comfortable houses in Kabul and sending the kids to good schools  but they were still very much connected to the customs and rhythms of ancient Afghanistan  a way of life that is dominated by the extended family  the clan  and Islam  Mr  Ansary's depiction of this world he grew up in is  I think  the most useful part of the book  He moves Muslim life beyond the caricatured way in which we currently perceive it  with its angry mullahs and its suicide bombers  and reveals a very appealing face of Islam  in which the aspiration is to peace and justice and where the communality and regularity of the daily prayers are more important than anti-Zionism and anti-Westernism  The Afghanistan of his childhood featured an Islam that still defined itself and was sufficient  rather than measuring itself against the West and failing the test At age sixteen  Mr  Ansary left Afghanistan for high school in America and has lived here ever since  He became a writer and  oddly enough  a part of West Coast counterculture  But when his brother  Riaz  became something of a Muslim extremist himself  Mr  Ansary undertook a long journey through the Islamic world  just as it was being radicalized in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian Revolution  The middle portion of the book describes his experiences in this transformed world and is futile attempt to return to his occupied homeland  He found  traveling mainly from Northern Africa to Turkey an Islamic world that was increasing focussed not just on the comforting and familiar Muslim traditions and observances  but on the strict observance of sharia  'The sharia ' I said  'Yes  that's what people have trouble with  It seems like such a harsh legal code  The cutting off of hands--' 'You have to understand that the sharia is much more than a legal system ' he said  interrupting me  'All the elements of the sharia--the rules of inheritance  the punishments set down for different crimes  the proscriptions about food and dress and all the rest of it--are like markers  They show where the road is  That's what sharia means--it is the way  The rules are not restrictive  as people think  because within the sharia  a Muslim is free  So long as the people of a community stay on the road  they progress toward the light  When they stray from the road  that's when they get into brambles and thorns 'Confronted by this much more legalistic and authoritarian form of Islamic life  Mr  Ansary realized that there was no longer any place for him in the East and he returned to the West for good  becoming   "Tamim Ansary  American guy  " Or so he thought  but then the events of last September intervened  and he found himself caught between his native and his adopted lands and between two cultures in conflict  His email expressed some of his angst over the dilemma  this book--though not always astute in its analyses of situations;
